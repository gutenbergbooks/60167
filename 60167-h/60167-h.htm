<p class="noindent"><span class="smc">I wanted</span> not to write an introduction to these three
plays, but circumstances are too strong for me. Yet,
after all, what is to be said but, to the public, “Here
they are; like them,” and, to the critics, “Here they
are; fall on them”? But apparently this is not
enough. I must think of something else.</p>

<p>There was a happy time when I was a critic myself.
I, too, have lived in that Arcady. What nights were
then! Red-letter nights when the play was bad, and
in one short hour, standing on the body of the dramatist,
I had delivered my funeral oration; black-letter nights
when the play was good, and it took six hours of solid
pushing, myself concealed by the fellow’s person, to
place him fairly in the sun. The years slip away. Yet
even now I have something of my old style. Here,
lest you should think I am boasting, is my <cite>Hamlet</cite>.
Yes, by the enterprise of <cite>The Saturday Review</cite>, I was
present on that historic first night. For, lately, this
paper stimulated its readers, with promise of reward,
to imagine themselves there as critics, and I brushed
up my old black doublet and went with the others.
Interested, you know, in this young provincial dramatist;
hoping against hope that here at last was the....

am I to say it) I won the prize.</p>

<blockquote>
<h3 title="Hamlet, a review">HAMLET</h3>

<p>Mr. William Shakespeare, whose well-meaning little
costume play <cite>Hamlet</cite> was given in London for the first
time last week, bears a name that is new to us, although
we understand, or at least are so assured by the management,
that he has a considerable local reputation in
Warwickshire as a sonneteer. Why a writer of graceful
little sonnets should have the ambition, still less conceive
himself to have the ability, to create a tragic
play capable of holding the attention of a London
audience for three hours, we are unable to imagine.
Merely to kill off seven (or was it eight?) of the leading
characters in a play is not to write a tragedy. It is
not thus that the great master-dramatists have purged
our souls with pity and with terror. Mr. Shakespeare,
like so many other young writers, mistakes violence
for power, and, in his unfortunate lighter moments,
buffoonery for humour. The real tragedy of last night
was that a writer should so misunderstand and misuse
the talent given to him.</p>

<p>For Mr. Shakespeare, one cannot deny, has talent.
He has a certain pleasing gift of words. Every now
and then a neat line catches the ear, as when Polonius
(well played by Mr. Macready Jones) warns his son
that “borrowing often loses a man his friends,” or
when Hamlet himself refers to death as “a shuffling
off of this mortal toil.” But a succession of neat lines
does not make a play. We require something more.
<a name="png.011" id="png.011" href="#png.011"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>xi<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Our interest must be held throughout: not by such
well-worn stage devices as the appearance of a ghostly
apparition, who strikes terror into the hearts only of
his fellow-actors; not by comic clowning business at
a grave-side; but by the spiritual development of
the characters. Mr. Shakespeare’s characters are no
more than mouthpieces for his rhythmic musings.
We can forgive a Prince of Denmark for soliloquising
in blank verse to the extent of fifty lines, recognising
this as a legitimate method of giving dignity to a royal
pronouncement; but what are we to say of a Captain
of Infantry who patly finishes off a broken line with
the exact number of syllables necessary to complete
the <i>iambus</i>? Have such people any semblance to life
at all? Indeed, the whole play gives us the impression
of having been written to the order of a manager as
a means of displaying this or that “line” which, in
the language of the day, he can “do just now.” Soliloquies
(unhampered by the presence of rivals) for the
popular star, a mad scene for the leading lady (in white),
a ghost for the electrician, a duel for the Academy-trained
fencers, a scene in dumb-show for the cinema-trained
rank-and-file—our author has provided for
them all. No doubt there is money in it, and a man
must live. But frankly we prefer Mr. Shakespeare
as a writer of sonnets.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>So much for Mr. Shakespeare. I differ from him
(as you were about to say) in that I prefer to see my
plays printed, and he obviously preferred to see his
acted. People sometimes say to me: “How beautifully
<a name="png.012" id="png.012" href="#png.012"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>xii<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Mary Brown played that part, and wasn’t John
Smith’s creation wonderful, and how tremendously
grateful you must be.” She did; it was; I am. The
more I see of actors and actresses at rehearsals (and
it is only at rehearsals of your own plays that you can
see them at all, or learn anything of their art), by so
much the more do I admire, am I amazed by, their
skill. There are heights and depths and breadths and
subtleties in acting, still more in producing, of which
the casual playgoer, even the regular playgoer if
he only sees the stage from the front, knows nothing.
But the fact remains that, to the author, the part must
always seem better than the player. That great
actor John Smith may “create” the part of Yorick,
but the author created it first, and created it, to his
own vision, every bit as much in flesh and blood as did,
later, the actor. You may read the plays here, and
say that this or the other character does not “live,”
meaning by this that you are unable to visualise him,
unable to imagine for yourself, granted the circumstance,
a person so acting, so reacting. Well—“If it
be so, so it is, you know”; it is very easy not to be a
great artist; I have failed. But do not believe that,
because a character does not live for you, therefore it
does not live for the author. While we are writing,
how can we help seeing the fellow? We shut our eyes,
and he is there; we open them, and he is there; we
dip our pen into the ink-pot, and he is waiting on the
edge for us. We shake him out on to the paper....
Ah, but now he is dead, you say. Well, well, he lived
a moment before.</p>

<p class="closeup"><a name="png.013" id="png.013" href="#png.013"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>xiii<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>So when John Smith “creates” the character of
Yorick, he creates him in his own image—John Smith-Yorick;
a great character, it may be, to those who
see him thus for the first time, but lacking something
to us who have lived with the other for months. For
the other was plain Yorick—and only himself could play
him. Alas, poor Yorick, I knew him well, a fellow of
most excellent fancy. Would that you could know
him too! Well, you may find him in the printed page
... or you may not ... but here only, if anywhere,
is he to be found.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  Yes, I was afraid it was. It
isn’t a very nice subject to talk about, is it, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Well, ma’am, it has its awkwardness like.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>after a pause, but not very hopefully</i>).  How is
the joint looking?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Well, it’s past looking like anything very
much.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, there’s the bone.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Yes, there’s the bone.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>gaily</i>).  Well, there we are, Mary. Soup.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  If you remember, ma’am, we had soup
yesterday.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>wistfully</i>).  Couldn’t you—couldn’t you squeeze
it again, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  It’s past squeezing, ma’am—in this world.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I was reading in a book the other day about
two people who went out to dinner one night—they
always dine late in books, Mary—and ordered a grilled
bone. It seemed such a funny thing to have, when
they had everything else to choose from. I suppose
<em>our</em> <span class="nw">bone——?</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Grilling wouldn’t do it no good, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, I suppose we mustn’t blame it. It
has been a good joint to <em>us</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  A good stayer, as you might say.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes. Well, I suppose we shall have to get
another.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh! (<i>Determined to be brave</i>) Well, that’s
fivepence.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  They are halfpenny stamps, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>utterly undone</i>).  Oh, Mary! What a very
unfortunate morning we’re having. (<i>Coaxingly</i>) Well,
anyhow it’s fourpence, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, now what can we get for fourpence?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span> (<i>stolidly</i>).  A turkey.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>laughing with complete happiness</i>).  Oh, Mary,
don’t be so gloomy about it. (<i>Collapsing into laughter
again</i>) Let’s have two turkeys—two tuppenny ones.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  It’s enough to make any one gloomy to see
a nice gentleman like Mr. Broxopp and a nice lady like
yourself starving in a garret.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I don’t know what a garret is, but if this
is one, I love garrets. And we’re not starving; we’ve
got fourpence. (<i>Becoming practical again</i>) What about
a nice chop?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  It isn’t much for two of you.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Three of us, Mary.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Oh, I can do all right on bread and cheese,
ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well then, so can I. And Jim can have the
chop. There! Now let me get on with my work.
(<i>Contemptuously to herself as she goes on with her drawing</i>)
Starving! And in a house <em>full</em> of bread and cheese!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Mr. Broxopp is not the sort of gentleman to
eat a chop while his wife is only eating a bit of cheese.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>with love in her voice and eyes</i>).  No, he isn’t!
(<i>Proudly</i>) Isn’t he a <em>fine</em> man, Mary?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Yes, he’s a real gentleman is Mr. Broxopp.
It’s queer he doesn’t make more money.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, you see, he’s an artist.</p>

 class="role">MARY</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  An artist? Now that’s funny, I’ve
never seen him painting any of his pictures.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I don’t mean that sort of an artist. I mean
<span class="nw">he’s——</span> (<i>Wrinkling her forehead</i>) Now, how did he put
it yesterday? He likes ideas for their own sake.
He wants to educate the public up to them. He
doesn’t believe in pandering to the public for
money. He’s in advance of his generation—like all
great artists.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span> (<i>hopefully</i>).  Yes, ma’am.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>pointing to the advertisement of Spenlow’s
suspenders</i>).  Now, there you see what I mean. Now
that’s what the artist in Mr. Broxopp feels that a suspender-advertisement
<em>ought</em> to be like. But Mr. Spenlow doesn’t agree with him. Mr. Spenlow says
it’s above the public’s head. And so he’s rejected
Jim’s work. That’s the worst of trying to work for
a man like Mr. Spenlow. He doesn’t understand
artists. Jim says that if <em>he</em> saw an advertisement like
that, he’d buy ten pairs at once, even if he never wore
anything but kilts. And Jim says you can’t work for
men like that, and one day he’ll write advertisements
for something of his own.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  Lor, ma’am! Well, I’ve often wondered
myself if it was quite decent for a gentleman like
Mr. Broxopp to write about things that aren’t spoken of in
ordinary give-and-take conversation. But <span class="nw">then——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>with pretty dignity</i>).  That is not the point,
Mary. An artist has no limitations of that sort. And—and
you’re interrupting me at my work.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span> (<i>going over to her and just touching her lightly
on the shoulder</i>).  Bless you, dearie, you <em>are</em> fond of him,
aren’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, I just love him. (<i>Eagerly</i>) And he
must have that chop to himself, Mary, and I’ll tell you
<a name="png.021" id="png.021" href="#png.021"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>7<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>what I’ll do. I’ll write him a little note to say I’ve
been invited out to dinner—and who do you think is
going to invite me? Why, you! And we’ll have our
bread and cheese together in the kitchen. Won’t
that be fun? (<i>Suddenly looking tragic</i>) Oh!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARY</span>.  What’s the matter, ma’am?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Why, perhaps he’ll go out again directly
after dinner and then I shan’t have seen him all day!
(<i>After thinking it over</i>) No, Mary, I shall have dinner
with him. (<i>Firmly</i>) But I shall say I’m <em>not</em> hungry.
(<i>There is a sound of whistling on the stairs.</i>) Listen,

me for such a long time and he’ll like to find me alone.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  It is, Nancy, it is! I have been singing
all the way home. (<i>Seriously</i>) Nancy, when we have
lots of money I think I shall learn to sing. An artist
like myself requires to give expression to his feelings
in his great moments. Several people on the bus

Fordyce, and I took him on one side and whispered
winged words into his ear. I said (<i>dramatically</i>)
“Fordyce fills you for fivepence.” It will be all over

Quick, while I’m sitting down. I shall be wanting

(<i>She comes to him.</i>) Nancy, it has been a hard struggle

“BROXOPP’S BEANS FOR BABIES.”</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>carried away</i>).  Darling!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes! I have begun. And now the world
will see what advertisement can do in the hands of an
artist. Broxopp’s Beans for Babies!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  But—(<i>timidly</i>) do babies like beans?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>confidently</i>).  They will. I can make them
like anything. I can make them <em>cry</em> for beans. They
will lean out of their little cradles and hold out their
little hands and say: “Broxopp. I want Broxopp.
Give me my beans.”</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>seeing them</i>).  The darlings. (<i>Business-like</i>)
Now tell me all about it.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>really meaning to this time</i>).  It began with—Ah,
Nancy, it began with <em>you</em>. I might have known
it would. I owe it, like everything else, to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>awed</i>).  To me?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  To you. It was the nail-brush.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  The nail-brush?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes, you told me the other day to buy a
nail-brush. (<i>Looking at his fingers</i>) You were quite
right. As you said, a gentleman is known by his hands.
I hadn’t thought of it before. Always tell me, darling.
Well, I went into a chemist’s. Fordyce had given me
fifteen guineas. I had the odd shillings in my pocket
and I suddenly remembered. There was a very nice
gentlemanly young fellow behind the counter, and as
sometimes happens on these occasions, I got into conversation
with him.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling to herself</i>).  Yes, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I told him something of my outlook on
life. I spoke of the lack of imagination which is the
curse of this country, instancing the man Spenlow as
an example of the type with whom we artists had to
<a name="png.027" id="png.027" href="#png.027"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>13<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>deal. He interrupted me to say that he had found it
so, too. A patent food which he had composed in his
leisure moments—I broke in hastily. “Tell me of
your food,” I said. “Perhaps,” and I smote my breast,
“perhaps <em>I</em> am the capitalist for whom you look.”</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  The five hundred pounds!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  The five hundred pounds. The nest-egg
which I had been keeping for just such a moment. In
a flash I saw that the moment had come.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>a little frightened</i>).  Then we shall never have
that five hundred pounds behind us again.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  But think of the thousands we shall have
in front of us! Millions!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  We seemed so safe with that in the bank.
My little inheritance. No, darling, I’m not disagreeing.
I know you’re quite right. But I’m just a little
frightened. You see, I’m not so brave as you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  But you will be brave <em>with</em> me? You
believe in me?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, yes, yes. (<i>Bravely</i>) Go on.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>going on</i>).  He told me about his discovery.
A food for babies. Thomson’s Food for Babies, he
called it. (<i>Scornfully</i>) No wonder nobody would look
at it. “The name you want on that food,” I said,
“is Broxopp.” Who is Thomson? Anybody. The
next man you meet may be Thomson. But there is
only one Broxopp—the Great Broxopp. (<i>With an
inspired air</i>) Broxopp’s Beans for Babies!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>timidly</i>).  I still don’t quite see why beans.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Nor did he, Nancy. “Mr. Thomson,” I
said, “this is <em>my</em> business. <em>You</em> go about inventing
foods. Do I interfere with you? No. I don’t say
that we must have this, that, and the other in it. All
I do is to put it on the market and advertise it. And
when I’m doing that, don’t you interfere with <em>me</em>.

the food—make it up into bean shape and let them

about it more that way. <i>Lucus a non lucendo.</i> Good-morning!”<!-- hyphen clear in original --></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  What does <em>that</em> mean?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>off-handedly</i>).  It’s Latin, dear, for calling
a thing black because it’s white. Thomson understood;
he’s an educated man, he’s not like Spenlow.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  And do we share the profits with Mr. Thomson?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  He’ll have to take some, of course, because
it’s his food. I shall be generous to him, Nancy; don’t
you be afraid of that.</p>

Queen’s Gate. Being the room in which he is generally
interviewed, it is handsomely furnished, as befits
a commercial prince. The desk with the telephone
on it, the bookcase, the chairs and sofa, the mantelpiece
are all handsome. But what really attracts your eye
is the large picture of the baby, looking at you over
the end of his cot, and saying: “I am a Broxopp
baby—are you?” At least, he says so on the posters;
this is the original, in a suitable gold frame, for which</i>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>at telephone</i>).  Hello.... Mr. Broxopp is
not here for the moment, sir. Can I take a message?...
To ring Mr. Morris up some time this morning.
Yes, sir.... Thank you, sir. (<i>He walks back to the
door and meets</i> <span class="role">ALICE</span> <i>coming in.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Oh, Mr. Benham, I was looking for you.
There’s a young woman, name of Johns, just come to
see the master. Would you wish to show her up
yourself, Mr. Benham? You see we’re not used to a
gentleman with us downstairs. It’s all so new to us.
When you were with His <span class="nw">Grace——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Who is this young woman?</p>

<p><a name="png.031" id="png.031" href="#png.031"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>17<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ALICE</span> (<i>giving card</i>).  She comes from one of the
newspapers.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>reading</i>).  “Miss Honoria Johns. Contributor
to <cite>The Queen</cite> and other leading journals.” (<i>Contemptuously</i>)
What does she want? An interview?</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  She didn’t say, Mr. Benham, but I expect
that’s what she wants.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I’ll send her away. Bless you, I had to
send hundreds of them away when I was with His
Grace.</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span> (<i>alarmed</i>).  Oh, but I don’t think Mr. Broxopp
would like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>staggered</i>).  Do you mean to say that he
wants to be interviewed?</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Oh, I’m sure he does. But I suppose he’s
gone to his office. Oh no, he hasn’t, because there’s
his hat.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>scandalised</i>).  His hat? Has he only got
one hat?</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Only one that he wears. What the papers
call the “Broxopp hat.”</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>to Heaven</i>).  If anybody had told me a year
ago that I should take service in a house where we
only wore one hat—but there! God moves in a
mysterious way, His wonders to perform.</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Oh, but it isn’t as if Mr. Broxopp was just
an ordinary gentleman. You mustn’t think that, Mr. Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  You all make too much of your Mr. Broxopp,
my girl. After all, who is he? What’s his family?</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Well, there’s only Mr. Jack, of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>contemptuously</i>).  Mr. Jack isn’t “family,”
my girl. Mr. Jack is “hissue.” Not but what Mr. Jack
is very well in his way. Eton and Oxford—I’ve
nothing to say against that, though I happen to be
<a name="png.032" id="png.032" href="#png.032"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>18<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Cambridge myself. But who’s the family? Broxopp!
There isn’t such a family.</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Well, but I’m sure he’s very rich, Mr. Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Rich, yes, but what does he <em>do</em> with his
money? Does he hunt or shoot? Does he entertain?
Has he got a country-house?</p>

<p><span class="role">ALICE</span> (<i>sticking to it</i>).  I’m sure you couldn’t find a
nicer gentleman than Sir Roger Tenterden who lives
next door, and came to dinner here only last Tuesday
with his daughter.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Tenterden? Ah, now that <em>is</em> family, my
girl. That’s the best I’ve heard of your Mr. Broxopp
as yet. But you mustn’t stand talking here all the
morning. Just go down and tell that young woman to
wait until I send for her. They’re used to waiting.</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">ALICE</span>.  Yes, Mr. Benham.</p>     <p class="rt">[<i>She goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>picking up hat delicately and putting it down

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, Benham, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  A gentleman rang up, your Grace—I beg
your pardon—“Sir,” I should have said.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Call me your Grace if it’s any comfort
to you, Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Settling down all right?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I am quite comfortable, sir, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I’m afraid you feel that you have come
down in the world?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  In a sense, yes, sir.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>19<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, you’ll have to climb up again,
Benham, that’s all. Did you ever read a little book—you
can get it at all bookstalls—called <cite>Broxoppiana</cite>?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  In a general way, sir, I read nothing later
than Lord Lytton.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>genially</i>).  Well, this is by Lord Broxopp—a
few suggestive thoughts that have occurred to me
from time to time—with photograph. On page 7 I
say this: “Going there is better fun than getting
there.” I’ve got there, Benham. You’re just going
there again. I envy you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.... I wonder if I might
take the liberty of asking your advice, sir, in a matter
of some importance to myself.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Why not?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  What is it? You want to get married?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>shocked</i>).  Heaven forbid, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, Benham, I’ve been married twenty-five
years, and I’ve never regretted it.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I suppose one soon gets used to it, sir.
What I wanted to take your advice about, sir, was a
little financial matter in which I am interested.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh!... I’m not sure that you’re wise,
Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Wise, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  In asking my advice about little financial
matters. I lost five thousand myself last month.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>alarmed</i>).  Not in West Africans, I trust, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  God knows what it was in. Jack said
they were going up.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I’m sure I’m sorry to hear it, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You needn’t be. That sort of thing
doesn’t worry me (<i>with a snap of the fingers</i>) that much.
I’d sooner lose five thousand on the Stock Exchange
<a name="png.034" id="png.034" href="#png.034"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>20<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>than lose one customer who might have bought a five
shilling bottle of Broxopp’s Beans, and didn’t. You
should speak to Sir Roger the next time he comes to
dinner. He’s gone into the City lately, and I daresay
he can put you on to a good thing.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir. It would be very condescending
of him. Would you like me to brush your
hat, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I should like you to tell me who this
gentleman was who rang up.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Oh, I beg your pardon, sir. A Mr. Morris.
He wishes you to communicate with him this morning,
sir, if convenient.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Morris? Ridiculous fellow. All right,
Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>He picks up the hat and goes out as</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>goes

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>at telephone</i>).  Central 99199 ... yes....
Is Mr. Morris in? Broxopp speaking.... Yes....
Hullo, is that you, Mr. Morris? Broxopp speaking....
Yes, I’ve got your letter.... Oh no, no, no,
I don’t care how good the offer is. I don’t want to
sell.... Well, you see, I happen to be interested
in Broxopp’s Beans.... Yes, yes, of course, but I
mean artistically interested. It’s my work, Morris;
it’s what I live for. I am much too fond of it to want
to share it with anybody.... That’s final, Morris....
Well, look here, if your man is as keen as all that
to buy Broxopp’s Beans I’ll tell you what I’ll do. (<i>He

Nancy, wasn’t it? We must put it in the next edition
of <cite>Broxoppiana</cite>. (<i>Thoughtfully</i>) I’m not often funny.
(<i>He kisses her hand and leads her to the sofa.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Dear one ... aren’t you going to the City
this morning?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>on the sofa with her</i>).  I don’t know. There’s
not much to do just now. Besides (<i>tapping his button-hole</i>),
how could I go?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  Oh, you baby. Have you been
waiting for me to put that in? (<i>She goes to a bowl of
carnations and takes one out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, I couldn’t go without it, could I?
Broxopp without his pink carnation—what would they
say in the City? And after you’d put it in for me for
twenty years, how could I put it in for myself?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>giving it the final touch</i>).  There!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>looking from it to her with a satisfied smile</i>). 
Now, then, give me a kiss, and perhaps I’ll go.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  You’re only a boy still, Jim; much younger
than Jack.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, Jack’s just at the age when they’re

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).  What I say is this, Nancy.
If a man can’t kiss his own wife, on his own sofa, without
being interrupted, he isn’t living in a home at all;
he’s living in an hotel. Now, I suppose that the dignified
gentleman who has just left us despises us from the
bottom of his heart. His Grace would never have been
so vulgar as to kiss his <em>own</em> wife on the sofa.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  It doesn’t matter very much, Jim, does it?
And I expect we shall get used to him.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I don’t know why we ever had the fellow—except
that Master Jack thought it went better with
Eton and Oxford. Eton and Oxford—was that your
idea or mine?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yours, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh! Well, the only thing they taught
him there was that his father’s tie was the wrong
shape.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>carried back as she looks up at the picture</i>). 
There never was a better baby than Jack.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>looking at the picture too</i>).  Yes, he used to
like my tie in those days. He was never so happy

specially interested in Broxopp’s Beans, Mr. Broxopp,
because I live in (<i>archly</i>) Bloomsbury, Mr. Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Really? When my wife (<i>he looks towards

That’s very curious.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  I’ve only been there the last few months.

that was where I began. There was a man called
Thomson ... but you wouldn’t be interested in <em>him</em>.

was worth it to be alone. Ah, Miss Johns, you see me
now in my beautiful home, surrounded by pictures,
books—(<i>He picks up the Shakespeare and reads the title</i>)
“The Works of Shakespeare” (<i>and puts it down again</i>)—costly
furniture—all that money can buy. And perhaps
you envy me. Yet I think I was happier in those old
days at Bloomsbury when I was fighting for my life....
Did you ever read a little book called <cite>Broxoppiana</cite>?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Now, isn’t that funny, Mr. Broxopp?
I bought it only last Saturday when I was going down
to my brother’s in the country.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, you may remember how I say,
“Going there is better fun than getting there.” It’s
true, Miss Johns.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span> (<i>proud of knowing it</i>).  Didn’t Stevenson
say something like that?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>firmly</i>).  Not in my hearing.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  I mean <em>the</em> Stevenson. I think he said,
“To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive.”</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes—well, that’s another way of putting
it. To travel hopefully is a better thing than to arrive.
So Stevenson found it out, too, did he? Well, he was
right.... All those years when I was building up
Broxopp’s Beans I was happy, really happy. I’m a
fighter. I like taking the public by the throat and
making them look at me. That’s over now. I’ve got
’em almost too tame. They come and eat the Beans
out of my hand. And though my success has given
me something—a comfortable home—servants to wait
upon me—butlers and what not—the best authors to
read—(<i>he picks up the Shakespeare and puts it down again</i>)—even
a son from Eton and Oxford to gladden my old
heart—yet I miss something. I miss the struggle of
those early days when my dear wife and I (<i>he has another

 class="ns">[</span>26<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>look at the door just in case</i>) set out together hand in
hand to beat the world. (<i>Sighing</i>) Ah, well! (<i>In a
business-like voice</i>) Now what can I tell you about myself,
Miss Johns? Pray, don’t be afraid of making any
notes that you like.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  I shall remember what you said,
Mr. Broxopp, without taking any notes.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Ah, well, you must please yourself about
that. (<i>Looking at his watch</i>) Now, then, I’m waiting
for you.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  <span class="nw">I——</span> (<i>She hesitates.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>kindly</i>).  Perhaps you’re not used to interviewing?
This is the first time you’ve done it, eh?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Well, I don’t do it, as a rule. And
I’m <span class="nw">afraid——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, perhaps I can help you with it.
You must send me your manuscript. My wife (<i>he
looks at the door with a frown—what has happened to her?</i>)
to whom I owe so much, was my first interviewer—ah,
that was many years ago. She picked up a guinea
for it, but that wasn’t the important thing. It was
the publicity. “A Talk with one of our Commercial
Princes”—I don’t suppose the Editor had ever even
heard of me. (<i>Chuckling</i>) Ah, but we bluffed him.
Lord, how we piled it on. “‘Tell me, Mr. Broxopp,’
I said—” that was my wife. “Mr. Broxopp leant
against his marble mantelpiece—” that was me—“and
fingered the well-known Broxopp tie—” (<i>indicating
it</i>) same one as this. “‘Ah, my dear boy,’
he said—” The dear boy was my wife, of course—she
signed herself N. R. Chillingham, her maiden
name; you women weren’t so popular on the Press in
those days—we pretended she was a man. “‘Ah, my
dear boy,’ he said, and I shall never forget the look
which came over his rugged face—” my wife didn’t
<a name="png.041" id="png.041" href="#png.041"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>27<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>like rugged, but I insisted; sounded more like a commercial
prince—“‘there is only one secret of success,
and that is hard work.’” (<i>With a sigh</i>) Ah, well, those
days are over. Happy days! The world seems to
have grown up since then. (<i>Looking at his watch</i>) Well,
Miss Johns?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span> (<i>very nervous</i>).  Mr. Broxopp, I don’t
know how to tell you. I didn’t really come to interview
you at all to-day.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>staggered</i>).  But your <span class="nw">card——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Oh, I am on the Press, and please,
Mr. Broxopp, I shall certainly write an article—perhaps
two articles—about what you’ve told me, and I do
live in the house where you used to live, and I was so
interested in you, <span class="nw">but——</span> (<i>She hesitates.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>mollified by the two articles</i>).  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span> (<i>making another effort</i>).  You see, I used
to live with my brother in the country. And he has
a small farm. And then I came to London. And he
has invented a chicken food and it is so good, and I
told him I’d ask you <span class="nw">if——</span> You see, I felt that I
knew you because of where I lived—I wondered—(<i>Taking the plunge</i>) Mr. Broxopp, did you ever think
of doing anything besides Broxopp’s Beans?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>nodding to himself</i>).  You wondered if I’d
take up this food? Put it on the market? Boom it?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Oh yes!</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>He thinks it over and then shakes his head slowly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You’re too late, Miss Johns.</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Oh, has somebody <span class="nw">else——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Twenty-four years too late. Now, if
you’d come to me twenty-four years <span class="nw">ago——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  But I was only six then. (<i>Hastily</i>) I
mean, about six.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes, if you’d come to me <span class="nw">then——</span>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  I’m afraid I oughtn’t to
have mentioned it.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, that’s all right. You’ll never get on
if you don’t mention things. (<i>Shaking hands</i>) Well,
good-bye. Mind, I shall expect to see that article—two,
didn’t you say? And if there’s anything else you
want to <span class="nw">know——</span> (<i>He stops beneath the picture on his
way with her to the door</i>) A pretty baby, wasn’t he?</p>

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>.  Lovely!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes, my wife and <span class="nw">I——</span> (<i>The door begins

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>coming in</i>).  Sorry. Are you engaged? (<i>He

despair comes into his face—he shrugs his shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span>). My boy Jack. Eton and
Oxford.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>And he looks it, too—except perhaps for his hair,

<p><span class="role">MISS JOHNS</span> (<i>now completely upset</i>).  How do you do?
It’s so nice to see the—I mean, we were just looking—but
I mustn’t keep you, Mr. Broxopp—and thank you so
much, and I’m so sorry that you—but of course I quite
understand. Good-bye! Good-bye! (<i>And she hurries out.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>strolling towards the sofa</i>).  Bit nervous, isn’t she?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You frightened her.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>sitting down</i>).  Fleet Street—and all that?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes. (<i>Looking round the room</i>) Where’s
my hat?</p>

him mischievously</i>) When are you going to begin?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>airily</i>).  Oh, as soon as I’ve got the studio
fixed up.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You still want to be an artist?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, dash it, I’ve only just begun wanting.
You’ve had twenty-five years of Broxopp’s Beans—and—and
I suppose you still want to go on, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Well, that’s true. Where’s my hat?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I say, never mind about that beastly hat.
You’ve got to stay at home this morning. I want to
talk to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>looking up from his search</i>).  Hullo, boy,
what’s the matter?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I say, do sit down—I keep losing sight of you.
(<span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>sits down obediently</i>.) That’s better.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>defensively</i>).  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  What’s happened?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  What do you mean—happened?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, what is it you want to tell me?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I didn’t say I wanted to tell you anything. I
just said, “Let’s have a talk.” I don’t see why a
father and a son shouldn’t have a little talk together
sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Neither do I, Jack. Only I thought
perhaps it wasn’t done. Bad form and all that.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Oh, rot!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You see, I don’t want you to be ashamed
of me.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>uneasily</i>).  I say, I wish you wouldn’t talk
like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, but I mean it. You see, I’m very
proud of <em>you</em>, Jack.</p>

blessed beans, aren’t you? Own up.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, you were born about the same time,
but I’ve always had more control over the beans.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>nervously</i>).  You know, I rather wonder sometimes,
now that we’ve decided that I’m not going into
the business, that you don’t chuck it yourself, and
retire into the country. It’s worth a good bit, I should
think, if you did want to sell it.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Would you invest the money for me?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>with a smile</i>).  Well, I own I had a bit of rotten
luck last time, but I daresay I’d do it as well as you
would.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  That’s not saying much. I don’t profess
to watch the markets.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Neither do I, only young Archie happened to
say that he’d heard from a man whose uncle knew a
fellow <span class="nw">who——</span> Well, it just didn’t come off, that’s all.
But Sir Roger knows all about that sort of thing. He’d
do it for you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, if I ever do want to sell it, I daresay
I’ll consult Sir Roger, but that won’t be for a long
time yet. (<i>He gets up</i>) <span class="nw">Well——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (jumping up hastily). No, look here, you mustn’t
go yet. We’ve only just begun to talk. (<i>Pushing
him back into his chair</i>) That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>good-humouredly</i>).  Is this a conspiracy to
keep me away from the office, or what?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>plunging at it</i>).  Dad, you see before you the
happiest man in the <span class="nw">world——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Oh!</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Only, it’s dashed difficult. (<i>Having another
shot</i>) What do you think Mother’s doing at this moment?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Just what I’ve been wondering. I wanted
her in here.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Iris Tenterden. (<i>But he can’t help being self-conscious

what you’ve been trying to get out all this time! (<i>He

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>more moved than he cares to show</i>).  Thanks, Dad!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>pulling himself up humorously</i>).  Tut, tut,
I was forgetting. (<i>Formally</i>) May I congratulate you,
Mr. Broxopp?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Silly old ass!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>sitting on the sofa with him</i>).  But this is
wonderful news. Why aren’t you more excited?
(<i>Apologetically</i>) I mean as excited as Eton and Oxford
will permit?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  You do like her?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Certainly. She has a way of—a way <span class="nw">of——</span>
Well, I can’t put it into words, Jack, but she’s the only
one of your friends who has told me frankly that she
doesn’t like my tie. The others try to convey the
impression that I’m not wearing a tie at all—that I am
in Holy Orders, or if not in Holy Orders, have a very
large beard <span class="nw">which——</span> (<i>He indicates with his hand how
such a beard would completely cover his tie.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, but your tie is a bit—well, <em>you</em> know,
I mean frankly, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Yes, but so am I a bit—well,
<em>you</em> know, I mean frankly, isn’t it? If I hadn’t been,
you would never have gone to Eton and Oxford. But
don’t think I don’t like Iris. I do—immensely. Well,
if you’re as happy together as Nancy and I have been,
you’ll do. Twenty-five years, Jack, and I always say
<span class="nw">that——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  She’ll do you a lot of good. But tell
me more about it. When did you first discover that
she was—a ripper?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Oh, months ago, but we only fixed it up at
that dance last night. I pushed round this morning
to see Sir Roger and talk things over. He’s coming
round for a pow-wow directly.</p>

yesterday that your mother and I were just beginning
to keep house together, and there was no Jack at all.</p>

to me.</p>

may <span class="nw">be——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Steady on, Dad. You’re not going to talk
to Iris like that, I hope.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a laugh</i>).  I shall be strictly proper
and respectable, my boy. Not a word shall escape
my lips of which you would disapprove.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  You know what I mean. When a young girl
has only just got engaged, you don’t want to start
talking <span class="nw">about——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Say no more. And so Sir Roger is coming
round too, is he?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  What does <em>he</em> say about it?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>knowing that it’s got to come now</i>).  Well, that’s
just it. You see Iris and I—I mean he and I—well,
of course I always thought so—I mean I don’t want

(<i>He bends towards her and she kisses him gently on the

Daddy Broxopp? Nancy doesn’t mind; I mean being

she’s going to let me call her Nancy because she’s so
young and pretty.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>enjoying it</i>).  And I’m not young and pretty?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  No, you’re middle-aged and Broxoppy. It’s
a nice thing to be.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>taking her hands again</i>).  Thank you for

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I don’t feel very young, with a big son

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  He? He’s only a baby. (<i>She blows a kiss to

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>resigned</i>).  Oh, Lord!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, Iris, if you’re as happy together as
Nancy and I have been, you’ll do. Twenty-five years
we have been married, and I always say that if it hadn’t
been for <span class="nw">Nancy——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>stopping him</i>).  Yes, dear.</p>

true. And what does Sir Roger say about it? (<i>The

Hullo, he does say something about it?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Oh, all right then.... Look here, Dad,
you’ll think me a beast for what I’m going to say, but
I want you and Mother to understand that it’s not just
a sudden idea put into my head by—(<i>he looks at</i> <span class="role">IRIS</span>
<i>and goes on</i>) by Sir Roger, but it’s what I’ve felt for
years.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well?</p>

<p class="rt">(<span class="role">NANCY</span> <i>takes his hand and presses it</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, then—I’m—<span class="nw">I’m——</span> (<i>From the heart</i>)
Well, I’m simply <em>fed up</em> with Broxopp’s Beans.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  But you haven’t had them since
you were a baby.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>seeing the opening</i>).  Haven’t had them? Have
I ever stopped having them? Weren’t they rammed
down my throat at school till I was sick of them? Did
they ever stop pulling my leg about them at Oxford?
Can I go anywhere without seeing that beastly poster—a
poster of me—me, if you please—practically naked—telling
everybody that I love my Beans. Don’t I
see my name—Broxopp, Broxopp, Broxopp—everywhere
in every size of lettering—on every omnibus,
on every hoarding; spelt out in three colours at night—B-R-O-X-O-P-P—until
I can hardly bear the sight of
it. Free bottles given away on my birthday, free
holidays for Broxopp mothers to celebrate my coming
of age! I’m not a man at all. I’m just a living advertisement
of Beans.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>quietly</i>).  I think that’s putting it a little
too strongly, Jack.</p>

<p class="rt"><a name="png.049" id="png.049" href="#png.049"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>35<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>(<span class="role">NANCY</span> <i>presses his hand and strokes it gently</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I know it is, but that’s how I’ve felt sometimes.
Of course I know that if it hadn’t been for
Broxopp, I’d be sitting on a high stool and lucky to
earn thirty bob a week. But you must see my side
of it, Dad. I want to paint. How can any one called
Broxopp be taken seriously as an artist? How can I
make any sort of name with all those Beans and babies
overshadowing me and keeping me out of the light? I
don’t say I’m ever going to be a great painter, but
how do I stand a chance as things are? “Have you
seen the new Broxopp?” What’s that going to mean
to anybody? Not that I’ve painted a picture, but that
you’ve brought out a new-sized bottle, or a full strength
for Invalids, or something.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I think you exaggerate, Jack.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I know I do. But you can’t get over it that
it’s going to be pretty rotten for me. It’s always been
rotten for <em>me</em>—and now it’s going to be rotten for
Iris.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Is it, Iris? You’d tell me the truth, I
know.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I want to marry Jack, Daddy Broxopp. But
I don’t want to marry the Beans. I told Nancy so.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>). I do understand, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I don’t want you to think that Iris put this
into my head. It’s always been there.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>frankly</i>).  I expect I brought it out, though.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  And what does Sir Roger say about it?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Sir Roger says that his grandson is not going
to have a name that every Tom, Dick and Harry gapes
at on the hoardings.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I ought to explain that Jack wants to marry
<em>me</em>, not Father’s way of expressing himself. I told
Father so.</p>

Don’t you, Dad?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Certainly, my boy.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>relieved</i>).  Good man. I thought you would.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  The only thing I’m wondering
is whether there is any chance of your seeing
mine.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Yours?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>on his own hearth</i>—<span class="role">THE GREAT BROXOPP</span>—<i>but
speaking quietly</i>).  I was educated at a Board school,
Iris—I daresay you’ve noticed it. I used to drop my
aitches—I don’t think you’ve noticed that—Nancy
got me out of it. I wear funny clothes—partly because
it is in keeping with the name I have made for myself;
partly, I daresay, because I’ve got no taste. But,
you see, at fourteen, the age at which Jack went to
Eton, I was earning my own living. I took a resolve
then. I told myself that one day I would make my
name of Broxopp famous. I made it famous. My
name; Broxopp. Well, that’s all. That’s my point
of view. But don’t think I don’t see yours.</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">IRIS</span> <i>looks at him wonderingly and then goes over
and sits by</i> <span class="role">NANCY’S</span> <i>side</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  You must be very, very proud of him.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I am, dear; he knows it.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>miserably</i>).  Well, of course, when you talk
like that, you only make me feel an utter beast.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  The only thing is that the utter
beast feeling might pass off. Whereas the feeling
about Broxopp’s Beans never will. It’s a rotten thing
to say, but I expect it’s true.</p>

you in the morning, but having just heard the great

Mrs. Broxopp? (<i>He smiles pleasantly at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling too</i>).  Indeed, we must.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>flattered</i>).  That’s very good of you, Sir
Roger. I need hardly say how delighted I am that
Jack and—er—your Iris should <span class="nw">have——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Quite so, quite so. Well, they’ve fixed
it up between themselves without consulting <em>us</em>,
Mrs. Broxopp—quite right too, eh, Iris?—eh, Jack?—(<i>he
gives them his pleasant smile</i>)—but we old people must
come in at the end and have our say. Eh, Broxopp?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Very glad to talk over anything you like,
Sir Roger. Of course, I should give Jack a suitable
<span class="nw">allowance——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>holding up a protesting hand</i>).  Ah,
<a name="png.052" id="png.052" href="#png.052"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>38<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>well—that—I have no doubt whatever—I, too, would see

That goes without saying. But naturally there are
also other matters which will require to be discussed.
I don’t know if <span class="nw">Jack——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  You mean about the Beans? I told Daddy
Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>blankly</i>).  You told—ah?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Daddy Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a proud smile</i>).  What she is pleased
to call me, Sir Roger.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Oh—ah—yes. Quite so. Well there,
we all understand the position. (<i>With his pleasant
smile</i>) That clears the ground, doesn’t it, Mrs. Broxopp?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  It’s much better to have things out.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  You put it admirably. It was with that
purpose that I came round this morning. Jack had
given me a hint of his feelings and—well, naturally, I
had my feelings, too. It is a matter which, after all,
concerns me very closely.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>puzzled</i>).  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Surely, my dear Broxopp! Iris’s child,
Jack’s child, would be—<em>my</em> grandson!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Father always looks well ahead. They have
to in the City—don’t they, Father?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>kindly</i>).  My dear Iris, we have to do
many things in the City, as Mr. Broxopp <span class="nw">knows——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, I know nothing of your part of the
City. I’m not a financier. It’s no good coming to <em>me</em>
for a good investment.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>with a bow</i>).  Then may I hope that you
will come to me if ever you should want one?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>taken aback</i>).  Thank you. It’s very good
of you, Sir Roger.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Not at all. But I was saying that we
<a name="png.053" id="png.053" href="#png.053"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>39<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>need not talk about the City now. In all walks of life
we have to look ahead. And I have to ask myself this,
Mrs. Broxopp. Is “Roger Broxopp” a desirable name
for—my grandson?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">JACK</span>). Father’s got as far as the christening
now. I shall have another baby directly.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>miserably</i>).  I wish he wouldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I see your point of view, Sir Roger. Don’t
think that I don’t see it.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>bowing</i>).  That is very generous of you.
And I think it is important. There is—ah—a poster
to which my attention has naturally been called,
saying—ah—“I am a Broxopp baby, are you?” I
<span class="nw">think——</span> (<i>He looks enquiringly at</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  That’s right, Sir Roger. I thought of
that twenty-five years ago. Do you remember,
Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>pressing his hand</i>).  I remember, Jim.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  An excellent poster for its purpose, I
have no doubt, Mrs. Broxopp. An excellent picture,
no doubt, of Master Jack at that age. (<i>He smiles at</i>
<span class="role">JACK</span>.) But seeing that all babies are pretty much
<span class="nw">alike——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>quickly</i>).  Oh no!</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>with a charming bow</i>).  Who would contradict
a woman on such a question? Let me say
rather that since, to the undiscerning male, all babies
are alike, there would be the danger, the very serious
danger, that people might suppose the words beneath
the picture to have been uttered by—(<i>he pauses
dramatically</i>) my grandson!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Roger Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Exactly. A Broxopp baby. (<i>To</i>
<span class="role">BROXOPP</span>) Of course I am saying nothing against the
food, which is, I am sure, admirably suited for its
<a name="png.054" id="png.054" href="#png.054"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>40<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>purpose. I am merely looking at the matter in the
interests of—my grandson.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Quite so, Sir Roger, quite so. You see
that, Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Well, my friend Jack has been talking
it over with me. I think we agree that for Mr. Broxopp
to retire from the business—and I am sure he has well
earned his rest after all these years of strenuous work—for
him to retire and settle down in the country, would
not altogether meet the case. The name of Broxopp
would continue with the business—one could not get
away from it. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>) I think I am right in
saying that?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Undoubtedly, Sir Roger. The name <em>is</em>
the business.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  That was my view. So our friend Jack
and I think that something more must be done. A
question merely of another name. He has suggested,
my dear Mrs. Broxopp (<i>with a bow</i>), your name, Chillingham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I don’t quite understand.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Merely that you should start your new
life—freed from the cares of business—as—ah—Chillingham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>to herself</i>).  Roger Chillingham.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>charmingly to</i> <span class="role">NANCY</span>). A name I should
be proud for my grandson to bear. I seem to remember
a Chillingham in the Coldstream with me years ago.
Are yours military people?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).  Oh yes! My father was a sergeant-major
in the Wiltshires.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>bearing it gallantly</i>).  Ah! A younger
branch, no doubt. But it is a good name, Chillingham.
<a name="png.055" id="png.055" href="#png.055"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>41<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>After all, why should the wife always take the husband’s
name? Eh, Mrs. Broxopp? Why should not the
husband take the wife’s, the son take the mother’s....
Jack Chillingham to Iris Tenterden. And a
handsome couple, are they not? I shall be proud of
my grandson.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>amused, as always, by her father</i>).  Say something,
Jack. A few words of thanks.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  You agree with me, Jack?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>mumbling</i>).  I’ve been telling Father.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Of course, I quite see your point of view,
Sir Roger. Don’t think that I don’t see it perfectly.
<em>You</em> see it, don’t you, Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh yes, dear. I should be very proud for
you to take my name. Just as I was very proud to take
yours.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Charmingly put, Mrs. Broxopp. But
alas! It is no longer your husband’s name. He has
been too generous with it. He has given it to the world.
That is what I have to think of—for my grandson.
(<i>He gets up</i>) Well, Mrs. Broxopp, I have to thank you
for listening to me so courteously, and I need not tell
you how glad I am that we see eye to eye in this matter.
Broxopp, we must have a talk some day in the City.
And if I can be of any assistance to you in the matter
of your investments, or in any other particular, pray
regard me as entirely at your service.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  It’s very good of you, Sir Roger.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Not at all. Jack, you’re dining with
us to-night, I understand. If you can spare him,
Mrs. Broxopp. Well, I must get along to the City. Busy
times just now. Good-bye, and again my apologies
for interrupting your morning.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Good-bye, Sir Roger. (<i>She rings the bell.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Then I shall be seeing you one of
<a name="png.056" id="png.056" href="#png.056"><span class="pagenum"><span

you get used to it—and then you aren’t overwhelmed.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Iris!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Nancy thinks I’m too modern. She’s afraid
that when we go out together, everybody will say,
“What a very fast creature Mrs. Broxopp’s elder
sister is!”</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Mrs. Chillingham’s elder sister, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  So it is, Daddy Chillingham.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>getting firmly to his feet</i>).  Look here, Dad, if
you don’t change yours, I don’t change mine. But
if you think you have given the Beans a good run for
their money, and you like to sell out and settle down
in the country as Chillingham, well, I’ll say thank you.
Iris and I have got precious little right to ask it, and
Sir Roger has got no right at <span class="nw">all——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>rising and protesting in the</i> <span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> <i>manner</i>). 
Surely, my dear Broxopp, I have a right to consider—my
grandson!</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Shut up, Iris, for a moment—no right at all,
but—but I’ll thank you. Only I’m not going to be
Chillingham while you and Mother are Broxopp. I’ve
made up my mind about that.</p>

And, of course, Jim will make him an allowance until

the same, Nancy, we <em>were</em> truthful. Artistically
truthful. An artist is a man who knows what to leave
out. Did I say that in <cite>Broxoppiana</cite>? (<i>Remembering
suddenly that there will never be another edition</i>) Oh,
well, it doesn’t matter now.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  You won’t mind very much? We’ve had
our time. It’s Jack’s time now.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes, we’ve had our time. Twenty-five
years. After all, we’ve had the best of the fun, Nancy.
Sir Roger is quite right about the name. It has been

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  But it’s for <em>you</em> to decide.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>jumping up</i>).  No, I’ll do the thing handsomely!
You didn’t marry a baronet, Nancy, an old

<a name="png.059" id="png.059" href="#png.059"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>45<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>a Tenterden way. I do my things the Broxopp way,

<div class="scena">
<p><span class="smc">Scene</span>: <i>The big hall in the country place which</i>
<span class="role">MR. CHILLINGHAM</span> (<i>né</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>) <i>has bought. Through
the open front doors can be seen a hint of the drive
and the park beyond. It was</i> <span class="role">JACK</span> <i>who chose it, and
he has done the</i> <span class="role">GREAT BROXOPP</span> <i>rather well; there
was no such view from that third floor in Bloomsbury</i>.</p>

<p><i>It is about four o’clock in the afternoon. Hidden away in
a big arm-chair sits</i> <span class="role">NORAH FIELD</span>, <i>deep in a book. She
is about twenty, wears a very short tweed skirt and
very serviceable country shoes, has very decided opinions,
and no hesitation at all about expressing them.</i> <span class="role">RONNY
DERWENT</span> <i>comes in</i>. <span class="role">RONNY</span> <i>is also twenty, but younger
than</i> <span class="role">NORAH</span>, <i>and with no views on life other than that
one’s hair ought to be kept well down. Without seeing</i>
<span class="role">NORAH</span>, <i>he rings the bell, and lights a cigarette while
waiting for</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span> <i>to attend to him</i>.</p>
</div>

<p class="grandentrance"><i>Enter</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span></p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Oh, I want a whisky and soda, please,
Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>from her chair</i>).  You don’t really want one,
Ronny.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Good Lord! I didn’t know you were
there.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  Mr. Derwent won’t have a whisky and
<a name="png.061" id="png.061" href="#png.061"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>47<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>soda, Benham; you can get him a glass of water if
he’s thirsty.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Look here, <span class="nw">Norah——</span> (<i>She looks at him, and
he ends up weakly</i>) Oh, very well.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Will you have the glass of water, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>sulkily</i>).  No, thanks.</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.</p>      <p class="rt">[<span class="role">BENHAM</span> <i>goes out</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  I didn’t know you were here, Norah. All
the same, I don’t know why I shouldn’t have a drink
if I want one.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  I can’t stand the way you children are always
wanting to drink. You’ve done nothing to make you
thirsty.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  If you knew a bit more, you’d know that it’s
doing nothing that makes you thirsty. Talk to me and
I’ll struggle on without it. What are you reading?</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  Nobody you’ve ever heard of, Ronny. A
man called Meredith.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Oh! Any good?</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>looking at him with a smile</i>).  In his way. A
different way from the <cite>Winning Post</cite>, you know.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>wanting to be fair</i>).  Oh, well, there’s no
accounting for tastes. Now, what do you think I found
old man Chillingham reading last night?</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>returning to her book</i>).  Don’t know.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  <cite>Broxoppiana.</cite> Ever heard of it?</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  I’ve seen it on the bookstalls.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  <cite>Broxoppiana.</cite> That’s the name of the heroine,
I suppose. And no better than she should be, if you
ask <em>me</em>, because, when old man Chillingham saw I was
looking, he slipped the book into his pocket and pretended
to be very busy over another one.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  And I suppose you looked over his shoulder
and found out what that one was too?</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Well, if you want to know, I didn’t. I knew
<a name="png.062" id="png.062" href="#png.062"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>48<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>what it was without looking over his shoulder. It
was <cite>The Science of Dry Fly Fishing</cite>. Old man Chillingham
trying to be a sportsman in his old age.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>shutting her book</i>).  I think you had better
have that whisky and soda, Ronny; at any rate, it
will prevent you trying to discuss your host with another
of his guests.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Rot, old girl. Jack’s my host.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  This is not Jack’s house.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Then why did Iris write to me as if it was?
“Dear Ronny, do come and spend a few days with us.—Yours
sincerely, Iris Chillingham.” How’s that, eh?</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>patiently</i>).  It is Mr. Chillingham’s house, but
Mrs. Chillingham has been away for a few weeks. So
Iris is playing hostess. I happened to mention that
I had a disreputable little boy-cousin called Ronald
Derwent, and she very <span class="nw">kindly——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Not so much of it, Norah. I knew Iris
before you did, and I knew Jack as soon as you did.
And if it’s old man Chillingham’s house, all I can say
is that old man Chillingham has got a pretty taste in
claret.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  Really, Ronny, to hear you talk about
claret, anybody would think that you were grown up.
Whereas we all know what you do with your threepence
a week every Saturday. Pear-drops, my lad, pear-drops.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>grimly</i>).  Very well, Norah, you’ve done for
yourself.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>He seizes a cushion and advances upon her. She
jumps out of the chair and runs to the other
side of the hall, picking up a cushion on the way.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  You’ll get your hair ruffled if you aren’t
careful.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  You’ll be lucky if you have any hair left by
<a name="png.063" id="png.063" href="#png.063"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>49<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>the time I’ve finished with you. (<i>He hurls a cushion
at her.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  Oh, rotten shot!</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>He goes to the sofa to get more cushions, and
dodges behind it as she flings hers at him.
They are interrupted by</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span>, <i>who is
crossing the hall with whisky and papers for</i>
<span class="role">SIR ROGER</span>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>who is about to throw a cushion</i>).  All right,
Benham. You go on.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>politely</i>).  After you, sir. (<i>The cushion
whizzes past his head at</i> <span class="role">NORAH</span>) Thank you, sir.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>He goes on to the morning-room. By the time that
he returns the combatants have disappeared,
leaving most of their ammunition behind them.
As he crosses by the window,</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>is seen
approaching from the outside</i>. <span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>is
now the complete country gentleman, with
fishing outfit. But he looks unhappy in his
new clothes, and he is not the</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>he was</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Ah, Benham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>taking his things</i>).  Any sport, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  No.... That is to say, <em>I</em> didn’t have any.
I can’t speak for the fish. They may have enjoyed it.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I’ve heard gentlemen say that it can be
a very attractive recreation, even when (<i>he looks into
the obviously empty basket</i>)—as in this case, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  To a man who really enjoys fishing—as I
am told I do—no doubt that is so.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, you’re quite an enthusiast, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  So they assure me, Benham. Golf is
another pastime to which—I understand—I am devoted.
(<i>He looks in astonishment at the disordered hall, with its
overturned chairs and scattered cushions</i>) Has anything
been happening?</p>

<p><a name="png.064" id="png.064" href="#png.064"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>50<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>as he begins to restore the place to order</i>). 
Nothing at all out of the way, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh!</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Quite a feature of the best country-house
life, sir, as you might say. The younger members of
the party are often extremely partial to it. In this
case, sir, Mr. Derwent and Miss Field were letting off
their high spirits with a few cushions. It brought
back the old castle days very pleasurably, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes.... Yes.... They come back, the
old days, don’t they, Benham?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  They do, indeed, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  Yes. Mrs. Chillingham has
not arrived yet, I suppose?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  No, sir. Is she expected back this afternoon?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Of course she is. The 4.10. (<i>Looking at
his watch</i>) I suppose the train was late. Didn’t
Mr. Jack tell you about sending in the car?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I have not had any instructions myself,
sir, but no doubt he informed Rogers. He was down
at the stables after lunch with Mr. Derwent.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Ah, yes.... Well, I’ll go and wash.
(<i>He moves off.</i>)</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Thank you, sir.</p>      <p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>is still in the hall, putting a cushion or
two straight, when</i> <span class="role">RONNY</span> <i>comes back, his hair
rather rumpled</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Hullo! Any luck?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>wishing to be fair to the sport</i>).  Compared
with yesterday—yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  What happened yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I fell in.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>tittering</i>).  Bad luck. I’m not frightfully
keen on fishing myself—I prefer golf. We’re having
<a name="png.065" id="png.065" href="#png.065"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>51<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>a foursome after tea; I expect you’d rather practise
by yourself, wouldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Thank you, I shall not be playing golf
after tea to-day.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  I thought you were so frightfully keen.
Jack said so.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Ah, well, Jack would know. But, you
see, Mrs. Chillingham will be here <span class="nw">directly——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Oh, is she coming back?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>nodding</i>).  Yes. She has been away three
weeks now, staying in London with her sister. She’ll
be glad to get back. She is very fond of the country,
you know. And this house.</p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span> (<i>kindly</i>).  Well, it isn’t half a bad place really.
I don’t know what the shooting’s like.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Very good, Jack’s friends tell me....
Well, I must go and wash, if you will excuse me, Mr. Derwent.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>He hurries out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  It’s all right, we won’t tell anybody. I suppose
I was as young as Ronny once, but it must have been
a long time ago. (<i>He goes to the bell and rings it</i>) Shall
we have tea in here?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  If you like.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  What is it, darling? Have you been bad?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  I’m a blessed idiot.</p>

<p class="grandentrance"><i>Enter</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span>.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Benham, is any one meeting the 4.10?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  I have given no instructions in the matter
myself, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Jack, do you mean to say that nobody is meeting
Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Kick me if you like, darling. It’s my fault
entirely. (<i>Looking at his watch</i>) Send the car at once,
Benham. It will probably be too late, but it can bring
the luggage along.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir. Rogers informs me that he only
requires the level five minutes when meeting trains—unhampered,
as you might say.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">IRIS</span>). I’m afraid she’ll walk through the
woods, you know. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span>) We’ll have tea in here.</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir.</p>      <p class="rt">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="role">BENHAM</span>.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Jack, you <em>have</em> been bad.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  After all, darling, it’s only a mile by the short
way, and it’s a jolly afternoon. There won’t be anything
about it in the papers.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>shaking her head at him</i>).  Oh, Jack! (<i>She sits
on the arm of his chair</i>) Jack, don’t you think it’s time
we had a house of our own? This has been very jolly
for a few months, but—you <em>do</em> want to get started on
your work, don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Of course I do, sweetheart. Only, we can’t
begin till we get the studio, can we?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  London’s full of studios, lazy one.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Yes, but you don’t realise how important it
is to an artist to get the exact surroundings. Now
<a name="png.067" id="png.067" href="#png.067"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>53<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>that we’ve found <em>the</em> studio in <em>all</em> London, and the man
who’s in it happens to be leaving in six months, it’s
absurd to go looking about for another. It’s simply a
question of waiting.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Six months?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, if we’re lucky, he might die suddenly....
You should read your Bible more. Moses, or
somebody, said that no husband ought to do any work
for a year after he’s married. I quite agree with him.
(<i>Playing with her hair</i>) Did I ever tell you that I much
prefer your hair to the stuff you see hanging in shop
windows in Bond Street?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>softly</i>).  Do you?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  It’s all fastened on quite naturally, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I think it must be.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Wonderful hair.... Did I ever tell you that
I like your eyes much better than the ones you see
lying about in fishmongers’ shops next to the ice?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Do you?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  They’ve got so much more expression....
Did I ever tell <span class="nw">you——</span> Hullo, here’s tea. (<span class="role">BENHAM</span>
<i>comes in</i>) Has the car gone, Benham?</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Good. Let’s hope the train’s late.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span> (<i>arranging the tea</i>).  I’m afraid it is not very
likely, sir. I remember His Grace once commenting
on the curious fact that, whenever one particularly
wished a train to be late, it was invariably punctual.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  His Grace seems to have been a highly original
thinker.</p>

<p><span class="role">BENHAM</span>.  Yes, sir, he was very well tolerated in the
family.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, this must seem rather a holiday for you
after the intellectual life at the Castle. You must
make the most of it, Benham.</p>

to return to Dixie.</p>

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>). This, Mr. Chillingham, is the

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  No, thanks, I’ll leave that to Norah’s husband.
When they are living in intellectual companionship
together, they can fire off epigrams at each other all
day long. What a life! Don’t you agree with me,
Mr. Chillingham? Have another bun, won’t you?
(<i>He takes one himself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Miss Field was talking about the marriage
of intellects. I remember. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">RONNY</span> <i>with the bun

<p><span class="role">NORAH</span>.  Don’t eat too many, Ronny. We’ve got
to beat them afterwards, you know. You’re not
playing, Mr. Chillingham?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  No, I think <span class="nw">I——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">RONNY</span>.  Well, you will, Jack, old boy.</p>

Talking to Jack and his friends. (<i>Grimly</i>) They are

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).  The world is getting

But never mind about me. Tell me about yourself.

 class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Just the same.... Where do you
think I was yesterday?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>excitedly</i>).  Broxopp’s?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>shaking her head</i>).  No—but not far wrong.
Bloomsbury way.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Number 26?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes! I happened to be that way, and I
thought I’d go past the door, and there was a board
up on the third floor, so I went in and asked to look
over the rooms—pretended I was just married. There
they were, just the same—and I did wish you had been
with me.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a laugh</i>).  We’ve climbed a bit since
those days.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  We always knew we should, didn’t we?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  And I began as an errand-boy at fourteen!
Let Mr. Ronny Derwent beat that if he can!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I’m sure Mr. Ronny Derwent couldn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>casually</i>).  And you didn’t happen to look
in at Broxopp’s at all?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh no. I don’t suppose anybody would
have known me.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).  Old Carter would—I suppose
he’s still there. They wouldn’t get rid of Carter. He
always used to remember how you came up the first
day we opened the office, and I’d had lunch sent in—do
you remember?—and a bottle of champagne. The
first champagne you’d ever had—do you remember,
Nancy?—and how frightened you were when the cork
came out?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>gently</i>).  I remember, Jim.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I thought perhaps you might just have
passed by outside—on your way somewhere. (<i>Wistfully</i>)
I suppose you still see the same—the same
advertisements everywhere? Have we—have they
got any new ones?</p>

<p><a name="png.075" id="png.075" href="#png.075"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>61<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">NANCY</span>.  I didn’t notice any.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>nodding his head</i>).  They can’t do better
than the old ones. (<i>After a pause</i>) Of course, there are
new ideas—(<i>he gets up and walks about</i>)—there was one
I was thinking of this morning when I was out—nothing
to do with me now—I just happened to think of it.
(<i>He is carried away by it as he goes on</i>) I don’t know if
you’ve ever seen a man drawing on a film—you see a
few lines first, which mean nothing, and then gradually
it begins to take shape. Well, you’d have your posters
like that—altering every week. A large poster with
just a few meaningless lines on it. Everybody would
wonder what it meant. They’d all talk about it. Next
week a curve here and there, a bit of shading somewhere.
People get more and more interested. What
is coming? And so it goes on. And then, in the last
week, the lines all join together, some of them become
writing, you see <span class="nw">“BROXOPP’S”——</span> (<i>He breaks off,
pulls himself together, and says casually</i>) The idea just
came to me this morning when I was out. Of course,
it’s nothing to do with me now. (<i>He gives a little laugh
and sits down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>who has been listening raptly</i>).  It’s a wonderful
idea.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>pleased</i>).  Not bad, is it? (<i>With an effort</i>)
However, that’s nothing to do with it, now.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  No, not now.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  And how did you leave Emily?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, she was very well. She sent her love
to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  That’s good. And did you bring me an
evening paper?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Of course I did. (<i>She takes it out
of her bag</i>) Knowing what a baby you are.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>apologetically</i>).  There’s something about
<a name="png.076" id="png.076" href="#png.076"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>62<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>an evening <span class="nw">paper——</span> You know, Nancy, I think I
miss my evening paper more than anything. (<i>He opens
it</i>) So much more happens in an evening paper. Of
course, this is an early edition.... And so Emily
was well, was she? That’s good.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  They’d had rather a fright about their
money. There was a Building Society—I forget its
name—all the advertisements said it was a wonderful
<span class="nw">investment——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  They didn’t put their money into it?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  They were just going to <span class="nw">when——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  That’s all right. Because here you are—in
the Stop Press News. (<i>Reading</i>) “Great City Failure.
Collapse of Excelsior Building Society.” Was that the
one?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Jim! (<i>Trying to remember</i>) Excelsior—no,
I don’t <span class="nw">think——</span> Well, it doesn’t matter, because they
didn’t put their money in, anyhow. A friend warned
<span class="nw">them——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Funny how everybody thinks he can make
money in the City without working for it. People
used to say to me, “You’re a business man.” I used
to say, “I’m not a business man. I’m an artist. I
have large ideas. I <em>employ</em> business men.” Same way
I employ Sir Roger. He knows; I don’t. I am above
all that.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I’ve been thinking about Sir Roger. <em>Does</em>
he know?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>a little alarmed</i>).  What do you mean,
Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Of course, he’s quite honest, but I think
sometimes we’ve been rather foolish in letting him
have so much to say in the investing of your money.
I suppose you keep an eye on things for yourself,
Jim?</p>

things with him. You’re quite right, Nancy. I’m
not going to let Sir Roger or any one else play ducks

exactly say anything</i>) enjoying yourself from morning
till night.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You, too, Nancy. A house always full
of people—plenty of servants to look after—bazaars

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  Yes!</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>They are silent again. Then</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>—<i>sure that

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You know, Nancy, sometimes I have
hoped—I mean, I have thought—that perhaps Sir
Roger—that perhaps he is being a little reckless—a
little foolish—that <span class="nw">perhaps——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).  Oh, Jim! Do you think he is?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Supposing he came to me and said, “The
fact is, Brox”—I mean Chillingham—“the fact is,
<a name="png.078" id="png.078" href="#png.078"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>64<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Chillingham, things haven’t turned out quite as I
expected, and—er—we have had losses.” I should
say, “That’s all right, Sir Roger, I don’t blame you;
you have done your best.” And even if it meant
giving up the house, <span class="nw">and——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  And the fishing, and the <span class="nw">golf——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Er—exactly. I shouldn’t reproach him.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  No, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>drawing his chair still closer and speaking
eagerly</i>).  Suppose we found that we only had £1000
a year left—I mean after we’d provided for Jack and
<span class="nw">Iris——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  A thousand?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, six hundred. I’m only supposing.
Six hundred. Enough for just a little house—well,
where shall we say? I—I don’t think the country,
do you?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, of course, I <em>do</em> like the country, Jim,
<span class="nw">but——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  The worst of the country is that people
will come and stay with you. One is never alone.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes.... And you <em>must</em> have your evening
paper.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a shrug</i>).  Oh, well.... Now, I thought
of a little house, Streatham way, as it might be. You’re
in touch with everything—you get the papers—you
have neighbours who don’t come and live with you,
but drop in when you want them—you can get to
London easily, and yet, at the same <span class="nw">time——</span> Or Norwood,
say.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Norwood, yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I daresay I should join the Borough
Council. I’ve no doubt I could give them a few
<span class="nw">ideas——</span></p>

Norwood Literary and Debating Society, no doubt.<!-- punctuation invisible -->
They might care about a lecture on modern methods

would be plenty to occupy us. What do you say,
Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).  I think perhaps £800 a year

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I’ve always liked the country.... Have
you had tea, Sir Roger?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Yes, yes, thank you, all I want. Been
busy all day, Mrs. Chillingham. A great nuisance,
business, on a day like this. And when there is so
much that is attractive all around one. And there’s
<a name="png.080" id="png.080" href="#png.080"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>66<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>your lucky husband—no cares at all—goes off <span class="nw">fishing——</span> By
the way, Chillingham, what luck?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>carelessly</i>).  Oh, about the usual.... Er—I
was—er—wanting to talk to you, Sir Roger, about—er—</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  My dear friend, by all means.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>preparing to go</i>).  Well, I must take off my
things. And you can talk business together. But
don’t keep him too long, Sir Roger, because I want
him.</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> <i>is moving politely to the door, but</i>
<span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>does not move</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a smile</i>).  You’re my business partner,
Nancy. I’ve no secrets from you. If you don’t mind,
Sir Roger?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  It is just as Mrs. Chillingham wishes.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  You can always tell me afterwards, Jim.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Nonsense, we may want your help. (<i>To</i>
<span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>) I remember once putting a little money
into a mine, which a friend had spoken well of. My
wife was very much against it—do you remember,
Nancy? She said that it would be much safer in the
bank. Well, she was quite right.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>sitting down again</i>).  Of course I was. (<i>With a
smile of remembrance</i>) But do you remember what fun
we had watching the papers to see whether it went
up or down?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Yes ... it went down.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Ah, what mine was that?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, I really forget now. Some Welsh
gold-mine, I believe.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Yes. I think I could have given you a
word of warning about Welsh gold-mines, Chillingham,
if you had consulted me.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  This was long before we had the pleasure
of knowing you, Sir Roger.</p>

<p><a name="png.081" id="png.081" href="#png.081"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>67<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Ah, a pity, a pity!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  That’s why we’re so glad to have your help
now. I should never have trusted Jim with all the
money he got from Broxopp’s Beans.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>wincing at the hated word</i>).  All the money
he—ah—retired with. Yes. Well, I hope, Chillingham,
I really hope that we shall be able to do something
for you before very long.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, I left it to you, Sir Roger. But
naturally I like to know how things are going on.
How are those oil shares?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Oil! Oil! Ah yes! Well, we have
lost a little there. (<i>With a charming smile</i>) You know
how it is, Mrs. Chillingham. One loses a little here,
and picks up a little more there.... Yes, I have
been disappointed over the oil.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I always think that something safe, however
little interest it pays, is—is safest.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Safer than losing it, my dear
Mrs. Chillingham—all women will agree with you there—but
not so pleasant as winning a little more. Your
husband sold his business at an unfortunate time. Our
hand was forced; we had to sell; we had to take
the price they offered. Naturally your husband felt
that a little speculation before <span class="nw">investing——</span> And had
it come <span class="nw">off——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>sharply</i>).  Had it come off, you say?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Exactly. As you know, my dear
Chillingham, one loses a little here and picks up a little
there. In the end, one finds that one has picked up a
good deal more than one has lost. If one knows the
ropes, Mrs. Chillingham.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>fiercely</i>).  How much of my money have
you lost?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>gently</i>).  I think, Chillingham, that that
<a name="png.082" id="png.082" href="#png.082"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>68<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>is hardly the way to put it. I am not (<i>with a bow</i>)
an absconding solicitor.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  (<i>To</i> <span class="role">JIM</span>)  Dear one!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  I beg your pardon, Sir Roger. But I
<span class="nw">understood——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>beautifully</i>).  My dear Chillingham, of
course, of course. I will let you have a note of your
investments this evening. Naturally you will wish
to conduct your business yourself in the future, or to
take other advice.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, but I’m sure Jim didn’t mean to
<span class="nw">suggest——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  That I was a knave? No,
hardly. But that I was a fool! Eh, Chillingham?
Oh, I think so. I think so.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>very uncomfortably</i>).  Sir Roger—you see—of
course I <span class="nw">don’t——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>holding up his hand</i>).  Please, please
don’t say any more. If anything, the apology should
come from me. I have lost your money. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">NANCY</span>,
<i>charmingly</i>) Yes, Mrs. Chillingham, a good deal of it.
And a good deal of my own, too. Fortunately I have
already taken steps to recover it. What we lose on
the oil, we gain on—shall I say the cocoanuts?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>prompting him</i>).  Jim! “That’s all right, Sir
Roger....”</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with an effort</i>).  That’s all right, Sir Roger.
I don’t blame you. You have done your best.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>amazed that there should have been any
thought of blame</i>).  I’m afraid that I haven’t made myself
clear. When I say <span class="nw">cocoanuts——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Sir Roger, has my husband lost much of
his money?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  My dear Mrs. Chillingham, five minutes
ago I should not have used the word “lost” at all. It
<a name="png.083" id="png.083" href="#png.083"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>69<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>was just, if I may put it so, the opening skirmish in
a campaign. One does not say that a campaign is
lost because at the first few <span class="nw">shots——</span> (<i>He shrugs his
shoulders.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes, I understand.... And the <span class="nw">cocoanuts——?</span></p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  A manner of speaking. Actually (<i>he
beams at them both</i>) a Building Society. Our motto
is—Excelsior!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>jumping up</i>).  The Excelsior? My money
is in that?</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  All, my dear Chillingham. And safe
as—shall I say houses? But, of course, whether you
leave it there or not is now a matter for your own
judgment. Between ourselves, Mrs. Chillingham, I
shall be glad to be relieved of the responsibility. (<i>Looking
through the window</i>) Beautiful weather we’re having
just now. The young people are out enjoying themselves,
I suppose? Golf, what? No cares, no
responsibilities—lucky young people! (<i>He gives them
a pleasant nod and goes out.</i>)</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">BROXOPP</span> <i>and</i> <span class="role">NANCY</span> <i>stand looking at each other</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, Nancy?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Well, Jim?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a bitter laugh</i>).  Funny, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Well, it is rather.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with a groan</i>).  Funny! I said six hundred
a year—you said eight hundred—and now we shall
have tuppence.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  That’s what makes it rather funny.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Sir Roger’s a fool, but I’m a worse one
to have trusted him.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  There’ll be something left.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  And yet—I daresay I’d do it again. There
were those Tenterdens and Jack. They wanted me
<a name="png.084" id="png.084" href="#png.084"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>70<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>to give up things for them—my name, my home, my
business. Well, I wasn’t going to give grudgingly.
Let them have it all, I said. Let Sir Roger play the
fool with my money, let Jack choose my house for me,
let Iris fill it with her friends. It was their show this
time. That’s the way I have to do things—the large
way. It—it appeals to me somehow, Nancy. Well,
you know me—you married that sort of man.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I’m glad I married that sort of man.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  And now he’s let you down.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  There’ll be something left. We were just
<span class="nw">saying——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).  There’s Jack to remember.
We must give him his chance—he may be
a genius—my son—(<i>as an afterthought</i>) your son—why
not?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes, dear.... If we only had five hundred
a year, it wouldn’t be—I could make you comfortable—even
four <span class="nw">hundred——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>taken by surprise</i>).  Oh, how you startled

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  I must <span class="nw">apologise——</span></p>

And it’s the maid’s afternoon out.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>a little blankly</i>).  Oh—ah—yes. They
told me down below to come up and—<span class="nw">ah——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  That’s right. I just went out to get some
kidneys. (<i>She holds up a parcel, and</i> <span class="role">SIR ROGER</span> <i>shudders</i>.)
I haven’t bought kidneys for I don’t know how many

How’s Iris? We haven’t seen her lately. (<i>She leads

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Is Iris quite well?</p>

We have a note from him every now and then saying that
they will come and see us when his picture is finished.</p>

Iris has not condescended to communicate with me
since—<span class="nw">ah——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Since we lost all our money.</p>

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span>.  Since that very unfortunate Excelsior
business. Upon my word, I don’t know what the City
is coming to nowadays. With so many rogues about,
it is almost impossible for a gentleman to make an
honest living. However, things have been looking
up lately. (<i>Smiling to himself</i>) Oh yes, looking up—decidedly.
But then I knew they would. I only wish,
my dear Mrs. Chillingham, that your husband could

<p><span class="role">TENTERDEN</span> (<i>holding up a hand</i>).  Don’t think I am
blaming your husband. Pray don’t think that. I
assure you, I quite understand. And so Jack is painting?
Making quite a good living by it, what? You
relieve my mind considerably, Mrs. Chillingham. I
shall go away happy now. I shouldn’t have liked to
think that my daughter was uncomfortable. What a

And Mr. Chillingham, I trust, quite well?</p>

of making it again first. (<i>With an air</i>) Madam, you see
before you The Great Chillingham!... (<i>A little hurt</i>)
You don’t say anything.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>at her drawing again</i>).  Darling! (<i>But how
she would have flown to him twenty-five years ago!</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Perhaps it is as well. The Great Chillingham
is not yet before you. I spoke too soon. (<i>He
begins to undo the parcels.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>mechanically</i>).  Yes, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Wait! (<i>He opens the parcels—a Chillingham
grey hat and a Chillingham pink tie are disclosed</i>)
Permit me, madam, to introduce to you the Chillingham
hat and the Chillingham tie! (<i>He holds them
up.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>wistfully</i>).  There has never been more than
one Broxopp baby!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  This is not babyness; it’s business. I
called on the Aquavim people to-day—the Brain Tonic
for Tired Workers. I announced that I was willing
to undertake the entire management and reconstruction
of their business for them. They declined. I then
said that temporarily, and until greater opportunities
offered, I might be induced to advertise their poison
for them. They replied that they no longer wrote
their own advertisements; they were written for them
<a name="png.092" id="png.092" href="#png.092"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>78<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>by eminent authors, actors, painters, soldiers, and
statesmen, in exchange for a few bottles and the
publicity which it brought them. I said modestly that,
if it came to that, I myself was at one time not unknown
in the world of commerce. The manager looked at my
card again, and regretted that he could not seem to
recall the name of Chillingham. That opened my
eyes, Nancy, and I decided that all the world should
know (<i>putting on the bowler hat and striking an attitude</i>)
The Great Chillingham! But you’ll see it better
directly, when I’ve got the tie on.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>going to him</i>).  Say you don’t regret Broxopp
very much!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Does an artist regret selling a picture
after he has painted it? I made the name of Broxopp,
and when I had made it, I sold it. Now I’m going to
make the name of Chillingham. I can make any name—with
you helping me, Nancy.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>hopefully</i>).  Of course you can. (<i>Twenty-five
years ago how certain she would have been!</i>) Have you
decided what we shall make the name of Chillingham
famous about?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>offhand</i>).  Well, well, there’s no hurry. I
shall find something. I shall think of something
directly. Don’t let us be in a hurry. (<i>Taking off his
hat and regarding it</i>) I think the new hat is striking—don’t
you? But keep the old one, Nancy. When the
story of my life comes to be written, the author may
wish to see it personally. Well, I’ll go and put the tie
on.... But I was forgetting. Who do you think I
saw to-day?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).  Not Jack?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Jack.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  But why didn’t you tell me? How is he?

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Why “Oh, Nancy!”?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  To see you in this room—after what you’re
accustomed to.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  But I’m accustomed to this. This is
where we lived before Jack was born.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I know. And now Jack and I have brought
you back to it.... Do you forgive me?</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  I shan’t if you talk so foolishly.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  You’ll never forgive Father, of course. Neither

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Yes. I’m not sure that you ought to have....

The</i> <span class="role">GREAT CHILLINGHAM</span>! <i>He pulls up at

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Hallo, boy. So you’ve come.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Hallo, Dad.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Iris here?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Yes, she’s in with mother.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  How are you getting on? We haven’t
seen much of you lately.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, we’ve all been working so hard. (<i>Going
up to him</i>) You’re looking extraordinarily bright, Dad.
(<i>He puts an arm affectionately round his father’s shoulder
and fingers the Chillingham tie</i>) Who’s your lady
friend?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).  Have you never heard of the
Chillingham tie, boy?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Never. Is that it?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  It is. (<i>Simply</i>) It will be heard of one day.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  I’m sure it will. I can almost hear
it now. (<i>Patting him affectionately</i>) Dear old Dad—I’ve
been a rotten son to you, haven’t I? (<i>He drops into
a chair.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>considering it fairly</i>).  No, I won’t say that,
Jack. You were a very good son to me when you were
a baby. You did a lot for the Broxopp business, and I
used to like telling people in the City all the funny
little things you said. Besides, you made your mother
very happy. And then, when you were growing up, I
used to enjoy talking about my boy at Eton and my
boy at Oxford. One way and another I’ve got a good
deal of happiness out of you.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  And then, when I was grown up, you suddenly
found that I was a selfish beast.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  You can’t expect father and son to see
things the same way. One or the other has got to be
<a name="png.096" id="png.096" href="#png.096"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>82<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>selfish. It’s generally the father.... Well, and how’s
the picture? Finished?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Wait till Iris comes in. We’ve decided to
tell you our sad story hand in hand. Besides, while
we’ve got the chance, there’s something I want you
to tell <em>me</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, what is it?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, then—as man to man—how are you
getting on?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  As man to man, Jack, I am really happy
again.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Yes, I know, but I didn’t ask if you were
happy. I asked you how you were getting on.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>refusing to be cornered</i>).  This is the life I
like, my boy. It’s harder than it was when I first
began, but I made good once, and I can do it again.
(<i>Thumping the table</i>) I like doing it.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>plaintively</i>).  Yes, but you still haven’t told me
how you are getting on.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Don’t you worry about <em>me</em>. I’ll make my
fortune again long before you make yours with painting.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Yes, you might well do that.... Look here,
you gave me £500 a year out of the wreck. Did you
leave anything for yourself?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Of course I did. Don’t you worry about
me. The moment will come and I shall seize it. Just
at present I am looking round. Don’t you worry about
<em>me</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, all I can say is you’re a sportsman,
and good luck to you.</p>

<p class="grandentrance"><span class="role">NANCY</span> <i>and</i> <span class="role">IRIS</span> <i>come in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Hallo, Daddy Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>kissing her</i>).  Hallo, my girl. You haven’t
called me that for a long time.</p>

going to forgive me? She has.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Forgive you for what?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Well, for not having been an orphan for one
thing.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>shaking her head at her with a smile</i>).  Iris!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  And for putting a lot of nonsense into Jack’s

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  My dear girl, any nonsense in my head came
there of itself; it wasn’t put in by you.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Well, there it was, anyhow. The fact is,
Daddy Broxopp, we’ve made a discovery in the last
few months.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Hallo, what’s that?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Well, it’s rather important. Are you ready,
Jack? (<i>Taking</i> <span class="role">JACK’S</span> <i>hand</i>) We have <span class="nw">discovered——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Once, finally and for <span class="nw">all——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  That Jack <span class="nw">Chillingham——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  <i>Né</i> <span class="nw">Broxopp——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  He cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> and <span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>together</i>).  He cannot, cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span> (<i>knowing what it feels like</i>).  Oh, Jack, what a
disappointment for you!</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  How did you discover it, boy?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  By regarding my latest masterpiece in a dispassionate
light. You ought to have seen it, Dad. It
was called “The First Meeting of Henry V. with
Katherine of France.”</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I sat for Katherine.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  She also stood for Henry V. I wish you had
seen her as Henry V.; it would have been a surprise
for you.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  I was jolly good.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  It was going to be my Academy picture. That
<a name="png.098" id="png.098" href="#png.098"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>84<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>was why I chose that subject. It was the dullest I
could think of. Unfortunately, when I had finished it,
I regarded it in a dispassionate light, and—(<i>frankly</i>)
it was rotten.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Very rotten.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Very, very rotten.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, poor Jack! I understand how you must
have felt.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  Well, then, we put our heads together.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>leaning her head against his</i>).  Like this.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  And decided that we were taking your money
under false pretences.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Because, you see, he cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span>.  He cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> and <span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>together</i>).  He cannot, cannot paint.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Well, what are you going to do, then?</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Give you back your money, of
course.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Don’t be silly. I didn’t mean that. What
work are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>wandering round the room</i>).  Well, that’s rather
the question. Iris thought—(<i>He stops suddenly at the
sight of his mother’s drawing</i>) Oh, Lord, here’s this
again. What on <span class="nw">earth——?</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>off-handedly</i>).  Just a rough sketch for an
advertisement—a little idea of mine—Ajax defying
the lightning—your mother <span class="nw">was——</span> Well, then, Jack,
<span class="nw">you——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>looking up at his mother reproachfully</i>).  Mother,
darling!</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, Jack, Ajaxes are so hard.</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>sitting down and picking up the pencil</i>).  Oh,
but—Iris, you’ll have to stand for Ajax. Imagine
Dad’s the lightning and defy him like the dickens.
(<i>Beginning to draw</i>) Right foot out a bit more. Hands
<a name="png.099" id="png.099" href="#png.099"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>85<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>behind the back, I think. Keep the head well up—as
though you thought nothing of him.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Daddy Broxopp, I defy you. (<i>She gives a
glance at</i> <span class="role">JACK</span> <i>to make sure he is not looking, blows a hasty
kiss to</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>, <i>and hastily resumes her defiant attitude</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>drawing</i>).  You’d find yourself much safer with
a model, Mother, even for a rough sketch. You get
so much more life into it.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, Jack, I wish I could draw like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  He isn’t bad, is he?</p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>still at it</i>).  Keep your head up.... I can’t
draw—but when I say I can’t draw, I don’t mean the
same as when I say I can’t paint. You see—Listen!</p>

<p class="rt">(<i>A loud knocking is heard at the outer door.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span> (<i>nodding her head at</i> <span class="role">BROXOPP</span>). That’s you,
Daddy Broxopp. You did the lightning so well that
you’ve brought on the thunder.</p>

<p><span class="role">NANCY</span>.  Oh, I’d better go. The maid’s out.</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  No, you don’t; I’ll go. It’s Dad’s

his tie. Perhaps I can buy her off on the mat.</p>

<p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

He had some invention—what was it?—a
Chicken Food, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span>.  Oh, I have a wonderful memory. My

your telling me about this food which he had invented.
You wanted me to take it up. I said—now, what was
it I said?—I <span class="nw">said——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">JACK</span> (<i>looking up alertly</i>).  What’s happened to that

Chillingham eggs!</p>

<p><span class="role">IRIS</span>.  Chillingham and bacon for breakfast, Daddy
Broxopp.</p>

<p><span class="role">BROXOPP</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).  It’s a risk. It will want

down at this chap’s place to start with—enlarge whatever

<p><i>What</i> <span class="role">MR. LATIMER</span> <i>prefers to call the reception-room of
his house is really the hall. You come straight into
it through the heavy oak front door. But this door is
so well built, so well protected by a thick purple curtain,
and the room so well warmed by central heating, that
none of the usual disadvantages of a hall on a November
night attaches to it. Just now, of course, all the
curtains are drawn, so that the whole of this side of
the hall is purple-hung. In the middle of the room,
a little to the right, is a mahogany table, clothless,
laid for three. A beautiful blue bowl, filled with
purple anemones, helps, with the silver and the old
cut glass, to decorate it. Over the whole room there
is something of an Arabian-night-adventure air. In
the daytime, perhaps, it is an ordinary hall, furnished
a trifle freakishly, but in the night time one wonders
what is going to happen next.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>, <i>tall, stout, and grave, the major-domo of the
house, in a butler’s old-fashioned evening-dress, comes
in. He stands looking at the room to see that all is
as it should be, then walks to the table and gives a
little touch to it here and there. He turns round and
waits a moment. The Staff materialises suddenly—<a name="png.110" id="png.110" href="#png.110"><span class="pagenum"><span

and pretences and evasions. And somehow it seems
less—less sordid, if we begin our new life together in
a new country. (<i>With a little smile</i>) Perhaps the French
for what we are doing is not quite so crude as the
English.... Yes, I know it’s absurd of me, but
there it is.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>with a shrug</i>).  Oh, well! (<i>Taking out his

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>violently</i>).  Oh, why do men <em>always</em> want to
smoke, even up to the moment when they’re going to
eat? Can’t you breathe naturally for five minutes?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>sulkily, putting his case back</i>).  I beg your

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  No, I beg yours.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>relieved</i>).  So it is.... It’s probably a

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>with interest</i>).  Leonard, do you always arrange
something fascinating like this when you elope? I
think it’s so romantic of you. But don’t you think
that the mere running away is enough just at first?
Leaving the fogs and the frets of England, the weariness
and the coldness of it, and escaping together to
the warm, blue, sun-filled South—isn’t that romantic
enough? Why drag in a mysterious and impossible
inn, a mysterious and impossible Mr. Latimer? You
should have kept them for afterwards; for the time
when the poetry was wearing out, and we were beginning
to get used to each other.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  My dear girl, what <em>are</em> you driving at?
I say again—do you really think that I <em>arranged</em> all this?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Well, somebody did.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>The two Footmen and the two Chambermaids

“And I am—er—So-and-so, and this is—<span class="nw">er——”</span>
Exactly. I mean we can get on so much better without

(<i>Thoughtfully</i>) I think I shall call you Leonard.
There is something about you—forgive the liberty—something
Leonardish. (<i>With a very sweet smile to</i>
<span class="role">ANNE</span>) I am sure you agree with me.</p>

or whether I am dreaming it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>his back to</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>). And Leonard isn’t
wondering at all; he is just tapping his forehead with
a great deal of expression.</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">LEONARD</span>, <i>who was doing this, stops in some
confusion</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>coldly</i>).  I think we have had enough of
this, Mr. Latimer. I was giving you the benefit of
the doubt. If you are not mad, then I will ask you for
some other explanation of all this nonsense.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>sniffing at the flower in his button-hole</i>).  An
impetuous character, Leonard. It must be so obvious
to everybody else in the room that an explanation will
be forthcoming. But why not a friendly explanation
following a friendly supper?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Are we your guests?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Please.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  But there is still this question of names.
Now we agreed about <span class="nw">Leonard——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>awkwardly</i>).  Er—my wife.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Then I am tempted to leave out the
“Miss.”</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>annoyed again</i>).  Look <span class="nw">here——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>turning to him</i>).  But there is nothing to
look at if I do, Leonard. (<i>The Staff comes in.</i>) Ah,
supper! Will you sit here, Anne? (<i>He goes to the
head of the table, and indicates the chair on the right of
him.</i>) And you here, Leonard? (<i>The chair on the

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">DOMINIC</span> <i>and the Staff serve the supper. Five of

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  “A little fish, a bird, a little sweet. Enough
to drink, but not too much to eat.” I composed that
in my bath this morning. The wine has been waiting
for you since 1906. How different from the turbot!
’Twas but yesterday it scarce had heard the name of
Le-o-nard. (<i>They are all served with fish, and the wine
has been poured out.</i>) Dominic, dismiss the Staff. We
would be alone. (<i>They are alone. He rises, glass in
hand</i>) My friends, I will give you a toast. (<i>He raises
his glass</i>) A Happy Ending!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>lifting her glass</i>).  A Happy Ending!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  You don’t drink, Leonard. You would
have the adventure end unhappily, as is the way of
the modern novel?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  I don’t understand the beginning of it,
Mr. Latimer. I don’t—you will forgive me for saying
so—I don’t see how <em>you</em> came into it. Who <em>are</em> you?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Our host, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  So it seems, my dear. But in that case,
how did we come here? My chauffeur told us that this
was an hotel—your man assured me, when I asked,
<a name="png.119" id="png.119" href="#png.119"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>105<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>that it was an hotel, a sort of hotel. And now it seems
that we are in a private house. Moreover, we seem
to have been expected. And then again—if you will
forgive me—it appears to be an unusual kind of house.
I tell you frankly that I don’t understand it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I see your difficulty, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>stiffly</i>).  Nor am I accustomed to being
called Leonard by a perfect stranger.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  What you are saying for yourself is, “Who
is this man Latimer? Is he <em>known</em>? Is he in the
Stud Book?—I mean Debrett. Is he perhaps one of
the Hammersmith Latimers, or does he belong to the
Ealing Branch?”</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>calmly eating</i>).  What does it matter?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Yes, but then <em>you</em> like the fish. Leonard
doesn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  I have no fault to find with the fish. You
have an excellent cook.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>gravely bowing</i>).  I beg your pardon, I
thank you. (<span class="role">DOMINIC</span> <i>comes in</i>.) His lordship likes the

<p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  But of course!</p>

Don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I’m liking my supper.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I am so glad. (<i>As</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span> <i>is helped</i>) I shot
this bird myself. (<i>He looks at it through his glass</i>) What
is it, Dominic?</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  <i>Poulet en casserole</i> with mushrooms, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  <i>Poulet en casserole</i> with mushrooms. I
shot the mushrooms.... A large help for his lordship,
Dominic. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>) Let me introduce your
chicken to you, Leonard. One of the Buff-Orpingtons.

Either we have that explanation now, or else—Anne,

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).  Ah, but which is your way?</p>

off the track a little, but if you can put us on to the
Dover <span class="nw">Road——</span></p>

Your table was laid for three. For whom were the

Saunders! My chauffeur! Do you mean to <span class="nw">say——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Let me help you up, Leonard. You have
the wrong chair again. It is difficult to be properly
indignant in that one. (<i>He helps him into a sitting

I should like to know <em>why</em> you are so interested in us.
Who are you?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  No more than Mr. Latimer. It is a purely

because you are going the Dover Road, my dear, and
it is a dangerous road for a young girl to travel.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>very cool, very proud</i>).  I don’t think I asked

<p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>). He bumped it against my

was running away with—dear me, I forget her name—I
always forget names. I think he called her Pussy.
She had several children. (<i>Unconsciously he has shot
his cuff, and sees suddenly the note he has made</i>) What’s
this? “Dominic—Apt appearance of.” Ah, yes.
(<i>He turns to</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span>) It’s very simple. A little fad of
mine. There are bells everywhere in this room—in
every chair, on the table, in the floor; wherever I am,
I can press a bell for Dominic. He is always close at
hand on reception-evenings. Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  That was a little warning which you were
giving us just now?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>apologetically</i>).  Yes. I thought it better.
Leonard is so impetuous. Joseph and Jacob were
both amateur champions in their day. Dominic is a
very heavy fall-er. He never has to fall on a man
twice. If all this is quite understood at the beginning,
it makes it so much easier.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  Mr. Latimer, I assure you that
this is not a sudden freak of fancy, and that I know
my own mind. I ask you, as a gentleman, to open

her?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  My dear Leonard, why should your—your

What would she want to do in the garden in November?
Do be reasonable.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Suppose she wished to walk to the nearest

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  If you stood on Leonard’s shoulders you
might just reach the top of the wall.... Dominic
tells me that they have lost the key of the gates. Very
careless of them.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well, <span class="nw">I’m——</span> It’s monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Yes, but we can’t keep on saying that. Here

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  She is good enough to believe it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I am not a child. Do you think I haven’t
thought? The scandal, the good name I am going to
lose, the position of that other woman, I have thought

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  There is one thing of which you haven’t

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>not heeding him</i>).  Living alone here, a bachelor,

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I am the wicked woman, coming between the

Is that it, Mr. Latimer?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Rubbish! The happy home! Why, this

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  His first real chance of happiness! As he
said when he proposed to Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>upset</i>).  What’s that?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span>). May I ask <em>you</em> some questions

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Eustasia will divorce him?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  We shall not defend the suit.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  And then you will marry Anne?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Another insult. I shall not forget it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I beg your pardon. I simply wanted an
answer.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  He will marry me.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I see. And then, as the fairy-books tell

I live within my high walls which keep the world out;
I am old-fashioned, Anne. You are modern, you

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Anne does.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>raising her eyes to his</i>).  I take the risk, Mr. Latimer.</p>

 class="role">LATIMER</span>.  But a big risk.... Oh, believe me, I am
not so much out of the world as you think. Should I
have known all about you, should I have brought you
here, if I were? I know the world; I know the risks
of marriage. Marriage is an art—well, it’s a profession
in itself. (<i>Sharply</i>) And what are you doing?
Marrying a man whose only qualification for the profession
is that he has tried it once, and made a damned
hash of it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well, really, sir!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Isn’t it true?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well—er—I admit my marriage has not
been a happy one, but I venture to say—well, I don’t
wish to say anything against <span class="nw">Eustasia——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Go on. Life is too short for us to be
gentlemen all the time.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>explosively</i>).  Well, then, I say that not
even St. Michael and all his angels could have made
a success of it. I mean, not even St. Michael.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Yet you chose her.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Er—<span class="nw">well——</span> (<i>But he has nothing to say.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).  Miss Anne, I am not being
moral. You see, I am a very rich man, and we know
on good authority that it is difficult for a very rich man
to be a very good man. But being a very rich man I
try to spend my money so that it makes somebody else
happy besides myself. It’s the only happy way of
spending money, isn’t it? And it’s my hobby to prevent
people—to try if I can prevent people—making
unhappy marriages.... It’s wonderful what power
money gives you. Nobody realises it, because nobody
ever spends it save in the obvious ways.... You may
say that I should have prevented Leonard from marrying
Eustasia in the first place. I have done that sometimes.
I have asked two young people here—oh,
<a name="png.129" id="png.129" href="#png.129"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>115<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>properly chaperoned—and guests, not prisoners as you
are—two young people who thought that they were in
love, and I have tried to show each to the other in the
most unromantic light.... Sometimes the engagement
has been broken off. Sometimes they have
married and—lived happy ever after.... But mostly
it is my hobby to concentrate on those second marriages
into which people plunge—with no parents now to
restrain them—so much more hastily even than they
plunge into their first adventure. Yet how much more
carefully they should be considered, seeing that one
at least of the parties has already proved his utter
ignorance of the art of marriage.... And so, my dear
friends, when I hear—and a rich man has many means
of hearing—when I hear that two people are taking
the Dover Road, as you were taking it to-night, I venture
to stop them, and say, in the words of the fairy-book,
“Are you <em>sure</em> you are going to live happy ever after?”</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Your intentions may be good, but I can
only repeat that your interference is utterly unwarranted,
and you are entirely mistaken as to the power
and authority which your money gives you.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Authority, none. But power? (<i>He
laughs</i>) Why, my dear Leonard, if I offered you a
hundred thousand pounds to go back to your wife
to-night, this lady would never see you again.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well, of all the damnable things to <span class="nw">say——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  How damnable the truth is! Think it
over to-night, Leonard. You are a poor man for your
position—think of all the things you could do with a
hundred thousand pounds. Turn it over in your mind—and
then over and over again. A hundred thousand
pounds.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>For a moment it seems as if</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span> <i>is beginning
to turn it, but</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span> <i>interrupts.</i>)</p>

Am I being shown my lover when he is mercenary?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>with a laugh</i>).  Oh no! If that were part
of my treatment, there would be no marriages at all.
Oh no, it isn’t a genuine offer. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>) It’s off,
Leonard. You needn’t think it out any more. (<span class="role">LEONARD</span>
<i>wakes up suddenly, a poor man.</i>) Besides, you misunderstand
me. I don’t want to separate you by
force—I have no right to.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  But how modest suddenly!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>with a bow and a smile</i>).  Madam, I admire
your spirit.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Leonard, I am receiving the attentions of
another man. Beware of jealousy.... All part of
the treatment, Mr. Latimer?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  You’re splendid. (<i>Seriously</i>) But I meant
what I said just now. I am not preventing you from
going the Dover Road, I am only asking you to wait
a few days and see how you get on. It may be that
you two are the perfect soul-mates; that your union
has already been decreed in Heaven and will be watched
over by the angels. If so, nobody will rejoice in your
happiness more than I. I shall not say, “You have
no right to be happy together. Leonard must remain
with his lawfully-wedded Eustasia.” Believe me, I do
not waste my money, my time, my breath in upholding
the sanctity of an unhappy marriage. I was brought
up in the sanctity of an unhappy marriage; even as a
child I knew all about it. (<i>Less seriously</i>) But oh, my
dear Anne, let us have a little common sense before
we adventure marriage with a man who is always
making a mess of it. We know what Leonard is—how
perfectly hopeless as a husband.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I don’t think that is quite fair.</p>

the year after next. (<i>There is a little silence.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  I think I will go to bed. How

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>deciding that the moment has come to put</i>

<p><i>It is next morning.</i> <span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>, <span class="role">LEONARD’S</span> <i>wife (who
should be sitting patiently at home wondering when
he will return), is having breakfast with a harmless
young man called</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>. <i>She is what people
who talk like that call a “nice little thing,” near
enough to thirty-five to begin to wish it were twenty-five.
At present she is making a good deal of fuss
over this dear boy</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>. <i>Breakfast is practically
over.</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>, <i>in fact, is wiping his mouth</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Finished, darling?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Yes, thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  A little more toast?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  No, thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Just a little tiny teeny-weeny bit, if his
Eustasia butters it for him?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  No, thank you. I’ve really finished.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Another cup of coffee?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  No, thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Just a little bit of a cup if his Eustasia
pours it out for her own Nicholas, and puts the sugar
in with her own ickle fingers?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  No more coffee, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Then he shall sit in a more comfy chair
while he smokes his nasty, horrid pipe, which he
loves so much better than his Eustasia. (<i>He gets up
<a name="png.135" id="png.135" href="#png.135"><span class="pagenum"><span

better?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>laughing uneasily</i>).  Of course he doesn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Kiss her to show that he doesn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>doing it gingerly</i>).  You baby!</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  And now give me your pipe. (<i>He gives it
to her reluctantly. She kisses it and gives it back to him.</i>)
There! And she doesn’t really think it’s a nasty,
horrid pipe, and she’s ever so sorry she said so....
Oh! (<i>She sees a dish of apples suddenly.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  What is it?</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Nicholas never had an apple!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Oh no, thanks, I don’t want one.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Oh, but he must have an apple! It’s so
good for him. An apple a day keeps the doctor away.
You <em>must</em> keep the doctor away, darling, else poor
Eustasia will be miserable.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>with an effort</i>).  I’ve finished my breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Not even if his Eustasia peels it for him?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  No, thank you. I assure you that I have
had all I want.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Sure?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Quite sure, thank you. Where are you
going to sit?</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>indicating the sofa</i>).  Nicholas sit there and
Eustasia sit next to him.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>without much enthusiasm</i>).  Right. (<i>They
sit down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Shall Eustasia fill his pipe for him? (<i>She
takes it.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>taking it back</i>).  No, thank you. It is filled.
(<i>They are silent for a little, and at last he speaks uncomfortably</i>)
Er—Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Yes, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  We’ve been here a week.</p>

week. And now to-day we leave this dear house where
we have been so happy together, and go out into the
world <span class="nw">together——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>who has not been listening to her</i>).  A week.
Except for the first day, we have had all our meals
alone together.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>sentimentally</i>).  Alone, Nicholas.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Four meals a day—that’s twenty-four
meals.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Twenty-four!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  And at every one of those meals you
have asked me at least four times to have something
more, when I had already said that I didn’t
want anything more; or, in other words, you
have forced me to say “No, thank you, Eustasia,”
ninety-six times when there was absolutely no need
for it.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>hurt</i>).  Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>inexorably</i>).  We are both young. I am
twenty-six, you <span class="nw">are——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>hopefully</i>).  Twenty-five.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>looking at her quickly and then away again</i>). 
You are twenty-five. If all goes well, we may look
to have fifty years more together. Say two thousand
five hundred weeks. Multiply that by a hundred, and
we see that in the course of our joint lives you will,
at the present rate, force me to say “No, thank you,
Eustasia,” two hundred and fifty thousand times more
than is necessary. (<i>He relights his pipe.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>pathetically</i>).  Nicholas! (<i>She applies her
handkerchief.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I wondered if we couldn’t come to some
arrangement about it. That’s all.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  You’re cruel! Cruel! (<i>She sobs piteously.</i>)</p>

Forgive me, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>between sobs</i>).  It’s only because I love you
so much, and w-want you to be well. And you m-must
eat.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Yes, yes, Eustasia, I know. It is dear
of you.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Ask any d-doctor. He would say you
m-must eat.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Yes, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  You m-must eat.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>resignedly</i>).  Yes, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>sitting up and wiping her eyes</i>).  What’s
a wife for, if it isn’t to look after her husband when
he’s ill, and to see that he eats?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  All right, dear, we won’t say anything
more about it.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  And when you had that horrid cold and
were so ill, the first day after we came here, I did look
after you, didn’t I, Nicholas, and take care of you and
make you well again?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  You did, dear. Don’t think I am not
grateful. You were very kind. (<i>Wincing at the recollection</i>)
Too kind.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  My husband.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Oh!... I’d never thought of him as
Leonard. I prefer not to think about him. I’ve never
seen him, and I don’t want to talk about him.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  No, darling. <em>I</em> don’t want to either.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  We’ve taken the plunge and—(<i>bravely</i>)
and we’re not going back on it.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Darling!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  As a man of honour <span class="nw">I——</span> Besides, you
can’t go back now—I mean I took you away, <span class="nw">and——</span> Well,
here we are. (<i>With determination</i>) Here we are.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Darling, you aren’t regretting?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>hastily</i>).  No, no! (<i>She takes out her handkerchief
ominously.</i>) No, no, no! (<i>She begins to sob.</i>)
<em>No! No!</em> (<i>He is almost shouting.</i>) Eustasia, listen!
I love you! I’m <em>not</em> regretting! I’ve <em>never</em> been
so happy! (<i>She is sobbing tumultuously.</i>) So happy,
Eustasia! I have never, never been so happy! <em>Can’t</em>
you hear?</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>throwing herself into his arms</i>).  Darling!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  There, there!</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>drying her eyes</i>).  Oh, Nicholas, you frightened
me so! Just for a moment I was afraid you were
regretting.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  No, no!</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  How right Mr. Latimer was!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>with conviction</i>).  He was indeed.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  How little we really knew of each other

absurd.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>in</i> <span class="role">LEONARD’S</span> <i>manner</i>).  Of course I don’t
wish to say anything against <span class="nw">Eustasia——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  My dear Leonard, I really think we might
leave your first wife out of it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Yes, you want to get that off pat. You’ll
have to say that a good deal, I expect. Well, to
resume. I am sorry to see in the paper this morning
that Beelzebub, upon whom I laid my shirt for the
2.30 race at Newmarket yesterday—and incidentally
your shirt too, darling—came in last, some five minutes
after the others had finished the course.... Tut,
tut, how annoying!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Oh, my poor darling!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  The word “poor” is well chosen. We are
ruined. I shall have to work.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  You know what I <em>want</em> you to do, Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  No, I have forgotten.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>seriously</i>).  I should like to see you in the
House of Lords, taking your rightful place as a leader
of men, making great speeches.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  My dear Anne! I may be a peer, but I
am not a dashed politician.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>wistfully</i>).  I wish you were, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I will be anything you like, Anne. (<i>He
leans towards her, half-serious, half-mocking.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>with a little laugh</i>).  How absurd you are!
Some more coffee?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>passing his cup</i>).  To which I answer, “A
little more milk.” Do you realise that this goes on for
fifty years?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Well, and why not?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Fifty years. A solemn thought. But do
not let it mar our pleasure in the meal that we are
<a name="png.145" id="png.145" href="#png.145"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>131<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>having together now. Let us continue to talk gaily
together. Tell me of any interesting dream you may
have had last night—any little adventure that befell
you in the bath—any bright thought that occurred to
you as you were dressing.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).  I had a very odd dream last
night.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I am longing to hear it, my love.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I dreamt that you and I were running away
together, Leonard, and that we lost our way and came
to what we thought was an hotel. But it was not an
hotel. It was a very mysterious house, kept by a very
mysterious man called Mr. Latimer.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  How very odd. Latimer? Latimer? No,
I don’t seem to have heard of the fellow.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  He told us that we were his prisoners. That
we must stay in his house a week before we went on
our way again. That all the doors were locked, and
there were high walls round the garden, that the gates
from the garden were locked, so that we could not
escape, and that we must wait a week together in his
house to see if we were really suited to each other.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  My dear, what an extraordinary dream!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  It <em>was</em> only a dream, wasn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Of course! What is there mysterious
about this house? What is there mysterious about
this—er—Mr. Latimer? And as for any one being
kept prisoner—here—in this respectable England—why!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  It is absurd, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Quite ridiculous.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>getting up—now she will show him</i>).  I thought
it was. (<i>She goes to the front door and turns the handle.
To her surprise the door opens. But</i> <span class="role">MR. LATIMER</span> <i>mustn’t
know that she is surprised</i>.) You see, I thought it was!

 class="ns">[</span>132<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>(<i>She steps out into the garden.</i>) You see, the gates are
open too! (<i>She comes back.</i>) What an absurd dream
to have had! (<i>She sits down again.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  There’s no accounting for dreams. I had
an absurd one too last night.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  What was it?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  A lonely house. Father and daughter
living together. Father old, selfish, absorbed in his
work. Daughter left to herself; her only companion,
books; knowing nothing of the world. A man comes
into her life—the first. He makes much of her. It is
a new experience for the daughter. She is grateful
to him, so grateful, so very proud that she means anything
to him. He tells her when it is too late that he
is married; talks of an impossible wife; tells her that
she is his real mate. Let her come with him and see
something of the world which she has never known.
She comes.... Dear me, what silly things one
dreams!</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Absurd things.... (<i>So he knows! He knows
all about it! But she will not be treated as a child. She
will carry it off yet.</i>) When can we have the car? (<i>Now
she is carrying it off.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  The car?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Leonard’s car.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  You wish to continue the adventure?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Why not?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Dear, dear! What a pity! (<i>Looking at
his watch.</i>) In twenty-five minutes?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  That will do nicely, thank you.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  We must let Leonard have a little breakfast
first, if he is to cross the Channel to-day. (<i>He
gets up.</i>) In twenty-five minutes then.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>half holding out her hand</i>).  I shall see you
again?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Ah, good morning, Leonard.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>starting violently and turning round</i>).  Good
Lord! I didn’t know you were there.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  You were so hungry.... I trust you
slept well.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Slept well! Of all the damned draughty
<span class="nw">rooms——</span> Yes, and what about my luggage?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Your luggage?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Yes, never put on the car, your fellow,
what’s ’is name—Joseph says.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Dear me, we must enquire into this. Lost
your luggage? Dear me, that’s a very unfortunate
start for a honeymoon. That means bad luck, Leonard.

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  I’m afraid not, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Owing to a regrettable misunderstanding,
sir, his lordship’s <span class="nw">luggage——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Yes, but I’m not talking about his twenty-five
other suits, I mean the nice brown suit that he
was wearing yesterday. It must be somewhere. I
remember noticing it. I <span class="nw">remember——</span> (<i>He holds
up his hand</i>) Just a moment, <span class="nw">Dominic——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  A-tish-oo!</p>

it, Dominic?</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir. I seem to remember the suit
to which you are referring. I regret to say that Joseph
had an unfortunate accident with it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>growling</i>).  Damned carelessness.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Joseph was bringing back the clothes
after brushing them, sir, and happened to have them
in his arms while bending over the bath in order to
test the temperature of the water for his lordship. A
little surprised by the unexpected heat of the water,
Joseph relinquished the clothes for a moment, and
precipitated them into the bath.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Dear me, how extremely careless of
Joseph!</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir, I have already reprimanded
him.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  The fellow ought to be shot.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  You’re quite right, Leonard. Dominic,
shoot Joseph this morning.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  And see that his lordship’s suit is dried
as soon as possible.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir. It is being dried now, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  But it must be dried thoroughly, Dominic.
His lordship has a nasty cold, <span class="nw">and——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  A-tish-oo!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  A very nasty one. I’m afraid you are
subject to colds, Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Do you hear that, Dominic? The first
one he’s ever had in his life.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir. If you remember, sir,
Mr. Nicholas, and one or two other gentlemen who have
slept there, caught a very nasty cold. Almost looks
<a name="png.150" id="png.150" href="#png.150"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  <em>I</em> didn’t catch it. It caught <em>me</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  The—the humiliation of it!... And what
do you propose to do now?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  As soon as my luggage turns up, and I
am well enough to <span class="nw">travel——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Under protest. (<i>Helping himself from the

that we have <span class="nw">here——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Well, that’s your third kidney; you’d better
make a note of it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).  As it happens I was helping
myself to a trifle more bacon.... As I say, I shall
keep a careful account, and send him a cheque for
our board and lodging as soon as we have left his roof.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Oh!... I had some coffee and one slice
of toast and a little marmalade. About a spoonful.
And a cup of tea and two thin slices of bread and butter
upstairs. Oh, and I’ve had two baths. They’re
extra, aren’t they? A hot one last night and a cold

last night, and you wouldn’t let me finish that, so I
expect there’ll be a reduction.... You want a note-book
with one of those little pencils in it.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>).  I say, Anne, look <span class="nw">here——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Do go on with your breakfast.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  You’re being awfully unfair. How can
we possibly go now? Why, I haven’t even got a pair
of trousers to put on.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  You’re not going to say you’ve lost those too!</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>sulkily</i>).  It’s not my fault. That fellow—What’s
’is <span class="nw">name——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>wonderingly</i>).  What made you ever <em>think</em>
that you could take anybody to the South of France?
Without any practice at all?... Now, if you had
been taking an aunt to Hammersmith—well, you might
have lost a bus or two ... and your hat might have
blown off ... and you would probably have found
yourselves at Hampstead the first two or three times
... and your aunt would have stood up the whole way
... but still you might have got there eventually.
I mean, it would be worth trying—if your aunt was
very anxious to get to Hammersmith. But the South
of France! My dear Leonard! It’s so audacious of you.</p>

You don’t mind waiting while Leonard has a shave?
He wanted to grow a special beard for the Continent,

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  What didn’t he say?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  No, <em>you</em> know the one I mean. How
does it begin?... “O woman, in our hours of

They throw it at you with both hands.</p>

You—(<i>pointing accusingly to</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span>)—are entirely unmoved

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>pressing her hand</i>).  Thank you.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>after a little silence</i>).  Well, as Nicholas said
just now, “Here we all are, and we’ve got to make
the best of it.” What are we all going to do?</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  I thought that her ladyship might require

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Thank you. I think it would be safer

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Yes, that’s right.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>). Did <em>you</em> have the screen?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Oh, rather.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  And the thermometer?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Yes.... Funny thing was I liked it
just at first. I don’t mean the actual thermometer,
I mean all the fussing.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  It’s a wonderful invention, a cold in the

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>coming close to</i> <span class="role">LATIMER</span>). I <span class="nw">say——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>indicating the screen</i>).  I say, not too loud.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>).  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well, what about it?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  What about what?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I mean, where do I come in? As a man
of honour, oughtn’t I to—<span class="nw">er——</span> You see what I
mean? Of course I want to do the right thing.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Naturally, my dear Nicholas. It’s what
one expected of you.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I thought that if I slipped away now,
unostentatiously....</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  With just a parting word of <span class="nw">farewell——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well, that was what I was wondering.
Would anything in the nature of a farewell be in good
taste?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I see your point.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Don’t think that I’m not just as devoted
to Eustasia as ever I was.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  But you feel that in the circumstances you
could worship her from afar with more propriety.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>waving a hand at the screen</i>).  Yes. You
see, I had no idea that they were so devoted.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Exactly. That’s why I thought I’d slip
away now.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Oh, Nicholas! Oh, Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>a little offended</i>).  Well, I don’t want to
say anything against <span class="nw">Eustasia——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  The house is full of people who don’t want
to say anything against Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  But, you <span class="nw">see——</span>Look out, here’s Miss
Anne.</p>

<p class="grandentrance"><span class="role">ANNE</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Anne, you’re just in time. Nicholas wants
your advice.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I say, shut up! We can’t very <span class="nw">well——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>with all that is left of her dignity, but she is only
a child after all</i>).  Mr. Latimer, I went upstairs to get
my things and find my way to the nearest railway
station. But—but there is a reason why I am not
going after all. Just yet. I thought I’d better tell you.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Were you really thinking of going? (<i>She
nods.</i>) I’m so glad you’ve changed your mind.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>with a smile</i>).  There are reasons why I had to.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Bless them!... Nicholas, I believe she
stayed just so that she might help you.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  What does Mr. Nicholas want?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I say, it’s awfully good of you and all
that, but this is rather—I mean, it’s a question that a
fellow ought to settle for himself.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  What he means is, ought <em>he</em> to get his
things and find his way to the nearest railway station?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>dismayed</i>).  Oh no!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  There you are, Nicholas.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>rather flattered</i>).  Oh, well—<span class="nw">well——</span> (<i>He
looks at her admiringly</i>) Well, perhaps you’re right.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>the three minutes up</i>).  There! (<i>She takes

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  His temperature! This is an exciting
moment in the history of the House of Lords. (<i>He
follows</i> <span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> <i>to the window</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span>). I say, do you really think I
ought to stay?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Please, Mr. Nicholas, I want you to stay.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Righto! then I’ll stay.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>over</i> <span class="role">EUSTASIA’S</span> <i>shoulder</i>).  A hundred and
nine.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>putting his head round the screen</i>).  I say,
what ought it to be?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Ninety-eight.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Good Lord! I’m dying!</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  It’s just ninety-nine. A little over normal,
Leonard, but nothing to matter.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  <em>Ninety</em>-nine—so it is. I should never have
forgiven myself if it had been a hundred and nine.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>coming up to</i> <span class="role">LATIMER</span>). It’s all right, I’m
going to.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Going to? Going to what?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>confused</i>).  Oh, nothing.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  What he means is that he is going to be
firm. He thinks we all ought to have a little talk about
things. Just to see where we are.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Well, things aren’t quite as they were,
are they? If I’d known that Leonard was ill—but I’ve
seen so little of him lately. And he’s <em>never</em> been ill
before!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Of course we ought to know where we are.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Yes. At present Leonard is behind that
screen, which makes it difficult to discuss things properly.
Leonard, could <span class="nw">you——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Oh, we mustn’t take any risks! But if
<a name="png.168" id="png.168" href="#png.168"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>154<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>we moved the screen a little, and all sat up at that end
of the <span class="nw">room——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Delightful!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>leading the way</i>).  Sit here, Miss Anne,
won’t you?</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>They arrange themselves.</i> <span class="role">LATIMER</span> <i>in the middle</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  There! Now, are we all here?... We
are. Then with your permission, Ladies and Gentlemen,
I will open the proceedings with a short speech.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Oh, I say, must you?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>). Hush, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  I didn’t say anything.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  No, but you were just going to.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>severely</i>).  Seeing that I refrained from
making my speech when Leonard had the thermometer
in his mouth, the least he can do now is to listen in
silence.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well, <span class="nw">I’m——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I resume.... By a fortunate concatenation
of circumstances, ladies and gentlemen—or, as
more illiterate men would say, by a bit of luck—two
runaway couples have met under my roof. No need
to mention names. You can all guess for yourselves.
But I call now—this is the end of my speech, Leonard—I
call now upon my noble friend on the right to tell
us just why he left the devoted wife by his side in
order to travel upon the Continent.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Well, <span class="nw">really——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Naturally Leonard does not wish to say
anything against Eustasia. Very creditable to him.
But can it be that the devoted wife by his side wishes
to say anything against Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  You neglected me, Leonard, you know
you did. And when I was so <span class="nw">ill——</span></p>

<p><a name="png.169" id="png.169" href="#png.169"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>155<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">LEONARD</span>.  My dear, you were <em>always</em> ill. That was
the trouble.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  And you were never ill, Leonard. <em>That</em>
was the trouble.... You heartless ruffian!</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>). Hush, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Why couldn’t you have had a cold sometimes?
Why couldn’t you have come home with a
broken leg, or lost your money, or made a rotten speech
in the House of Lords? If she could never be sorry
for <em>you</em>, for whom else could she be sorry, except herself?
(<i>To</i> <span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>) I don’t suppose he even lost his
umbrella, did he?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>feeling that anything is possible to a man who
mislays his trousers</i>).  Oh, he must have lost that.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Eustasia, ladies and gentlemen, is one of
those dear women, those sweet women, those delightful
women—(<i>aside to</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span>)—stop me if I’m overdoing
it—those adorable women who must always cosset or
be cosseted. She couldn’t cosset Leonard; Leonard
wouldn’t cosset her. Hence—the Dover Road.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  How well you understand, Mr. Latimer!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Enter, then, my friend Nicholas. (<i>Shaking
his head at him</i>) Oh, Nicholas! Oh, Nicholas! Oh,
Nicholas!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>uneasily</i>).  What’s all that about?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Anything you say will be used in evidence
against you. Proceed, my young friend.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well—well—well—I mean, there she was.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Lonely.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Exactly.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Neglected by her brute of a husband—(<i>As</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span> <i>opens his mouth</i>) fingers crossed, Leonard—who
spent day and night rioting in the House of Lords
while his poor little wife cried at home.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Suddenly? I’ve been wanting it ever since
that first morning. I went upstairs to get my hat,
meaning to walk straight out of the house—and then
I looked in my purse and found—(<i>pathetically</i>) three
and fourpence ha’penny. What was I to do?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Any one would have lent you anything.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>coldly</i>).  Leonard, for instance?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).  Well ... no.... No.
You couldn’t very well have touched Leonard. But
<span class="nw">Latimer——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Mr. Latimer! The man who had brought
us here, locked us up here, and started playing Providence
to us—I was to go on my knees to <em>him</em> and say,
<a name="png.174" id="png.174" href="#png.174"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>160<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>“Please, dear Mr. Latimer, could you lend me one
pound two and sixpence, so that I may run away from
your horrid house?” Really!</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well, you seem to have been pretty
friendly with him these three days.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Naturally I am polite to a man when I am
staying in his house. That’s different.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  As a matter of fact, Latimer has been
jolly decent. Anyway, he has saved us both from
making silly asses of ourselves.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  And you think I am grateful to him for
that?... Doesn’t <em>any</em> man understand <em>any</em> woman?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>annoyed</i>).  Are you suggesting that <em>I</em> don’t
understand women?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  I’m suggesting that you should lend me one
pound two shillings and sixpence.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>sulkily, feeling in his pockets</i>).  Of course,
if you’re in such a confounded hurry to get away from
<span class="nw">here——</span> Do you mind all silver?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Not at all.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  In such a confounded hurry to get away
from <span class="nw">here——</span> (<i>He counts the money.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Why ever should I want to stay?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well—<span class="nw">well——</span> (<i>With a despairing shrug</i>)
Oh, Lord!... Ten shillings ... fourteen and six
... why should she want to stay! Why do you
think <em>I’m</em> staying?</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>wickedly</i>).  Because you’re so fond of
Mr. Latimer. He’s so jolly decent.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>looking at the money in his hand</i>).  One
pound two shillings and sixpence. I suppose if I told
you what I really thought about it all, you’d get on
your high horse again and refuse the money from <em>me</em>.
So I won’t tell you. Here you are.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>gently</i>).  You didn’t think I was in love with
<a name="png.175" id="png.175" href="#png.175"><span class="pagenum"><span

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well—well, I don’t <span class="nw">see——</span> (<i>He holds
out the money. But</i> <span class="role">ANNE</span> <i>won’t take it on those

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  From a friend?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  From a friend.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span>.  Lent to a friend?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Lent to a friend.</p>

<p><span class="role">ANNE</span> (<i>taking it</i>).  Thank you, Nicholas. (<i>She hurries
out, clasping the precious money.</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> <i>will never see
her again.... And then, suddenly, her head comes round
the door</i>) Thank you very much, Nicholas! (<i>She is gone.</i>)</p>

(<i>To</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>) You will be better on the sofa, darling.
(<i>Distantly to</i> <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>) I’m so sorry to trouble you.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Not at all. I was just going anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  No, thank you, Eustasia. (<i>Now <em>he</em> is saying

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>with a sigh</i>).  No, thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  You’ve only got to say, you know. Now
shall we talk, or would you like me to read to you?
(<i>She settles down next to him.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>choosing the lesser evil</i>).  I think read—no,
I mean, talk—no, read to me.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  It’s for you to say, darling.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>his eyes closed</i>).  Read to me, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>opening her book</i>).  We’ll go on from where
we left off. We didn’t get very far—I marked the
place.... Yes, here we are. “... the sandy
<a name="png.177" id="png.177" href="#png.177"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>163<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>deserts of Arabia and Africa.... 4.” And then
there’s a little footnote at the bottom; that’s how I
remember it. (<i>Reading the footnote</i>) “Tacit. Annal.
l. ii., Dion Cassius l. lvi. p. 833, and the speech of
Augustus himself.” That doesn’t seem to mean much.
“It receives great light from the learned notes of his
French translator, M. Spanheim.” Well, that’s a good
thing. Spanheim—sounds more like a German, doesn’t
it? Now are you sure you’re quite comfortable, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>his eyes closed</i>).  Yes, thank you, Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Then I’ll begin. (<i>In her reading-aloud
voice</i>) “Happily for the repose of mankind, the moderate
system recommended by the wisdom of Augustus
was adopted by the fears and vices of his immediate
successors. Engaged in the pursuit of pleasure or the
exercise of tyranny, the first Caesars seldom showed
themselves to the armies or to the provinces; nor
were they disposed to suffer that those triumphs which
their indolence neglected should be usurped by the conduct
and valour of their lieutenants.” (<i>Speeding up</i>)
“The military fame of a subject was considered as an
insolent invasion of the Imperial prerogative; and it
became the duty as well as interest of every Roman
General to guard the frontiers entrusted to his care”—(<i>recklessly</i>)
“without aspiring for conquests which
might have proved no less fatal to himself than to the
vanquished barbarians.”... And then there’s another
little footnote. Perhaps it would be better if I read
all the little footnotes afterwards—what do you think,
darling? Or shall we take them as they come?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>without opening his eyes</i>).  Yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  Very well. This is footnote 5. “Germanicus,
Suetonius Paulinus and Agricola”—(<i>she
stumbles over the names</i>)—“were checked and recalled
in the course of their victories. Corbulo was put to
<a name="png.178" id="png.178" href="#png.178"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>164<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>death.” Oh, what a shame! “Military merit, as it is
admirably expressed by Tacitus, was, in the strictest
sense of the <span class="nw">word——”</span> well, there are <em>two</em> words, and
they are both in Latin. I suppose Tacitus wrote in
Latin. But it doesn’t really matter, because it’s only
a little footnote. (<i>Anxiously</i>) Are you liking the book,
darling?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Very much, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  It’s nicely written, but I don’t think it’s
very exciting. I don’t think Mr. Latimer has a very
good taste in books. I asked him to recommend me
something really interesting to read aloud, and he said
that the two most interesting books he knew were
Carlyle’s <cite>French Revolution</cite> and—and—(<i>looking at the
cover</i>) Gibbon’s <cite>Roman Empire</cite>.... Fancy, there are
four volumes of it and six hundred pages in a volume.
We’re at page 3 now. (<i>She reads a line or two to herself.</i>)
Oh, now, this is rather interesting, because it’s all
about <em>us</em>. “The only accession which the Roman
Empire received during the first century of the Christian
era was the province of Britain.” Fancy! “The
proximity of its situation to the coast of Gaul seemed
to invite their arms, the pleasing though doubtful
intelligence of a pearl fishery attracted their avarice.”
And then there’s a little footnote—I suppose that’s
to say it was Whitstable. (<i>Getting to it</i>) Oh no—“The
British pearls proved, however, of little value, on
account of their dark and livid colour.” How horrid.
“Tacitus <span class="nw">observes——”</span> well, then, Tacitus says
something again.... I <em>wish</em> he would write in English....
Now where was I? Something about the pearls.
Oh yes. “After a war of about forty years”—good
gracious!—“undertaken by the most stupid, maintained
by the most dissolute, <span class="nw">and——”</span></p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span>.  But I took his temperature <em>before</em> I began
reading.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Perhaps yesterday’s instalment was still
hanging about a bit.</p>

<p><span class="role">EUSTASIA</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">LEONARD</span>). No, darling, not to-night.

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Really, Leonard, I am surprised at you.
By the charm of my old-world courtesy and hospitality,
of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span>.  Oh! Well, I doubt if that keeps Eustasia.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>shaking his head sadly</i>).  I am afraid that
that is only too true. In fact, the more I think of it,
the more I realise that there is only one thing which
will keep this devoted wife from her afflicted and
suffering husband.</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> and <span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  What?</p>

<p class="grandentrance"><span class="role">DOMINIC</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  His lordship and Mr. Nicholas are leaving
at once. His lordship’s car will wait for them outside
the gates. See that a bag is packed for them.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  And come back when you’ve seen about
that.</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Yes, sir.      </p><p class="rt">[<i>He goes out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  The only way of keeping this devoted
wife from her afflicted and suffering husband?</p>

<p><span class="role">LEONARD</span> (<i>gruffly</i>).  Yes. What is it?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Somebody else must have a temperature.
Somebody else must be ill. Eustasia must have somebody
else to cosset.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  I say, how awfully sporting of you!</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Sporting?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  To sacrifice yourself like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  I? You don’t think <em>I</em> am going to sacrifice
myself, do you? No, no, it’s Dominic.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span> (<i>coming in</i>).  Yes, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Dominic, are you ever ill?</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  Never, sir, barring a slight shortness of
the breath.</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span> (<i>to the others</i>).  That’s awkward. I don’t
think you can cosset a shortness of the breath.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">DOMINIC</span>). I say, you could pretend to
be ill, couldn’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  With what object, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  Well—<span class="nw">er——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  Her ladyship is training to be a nurse.
She has already cured two very obstinate cases of nasal
catarrh accompanied by debility and a fluctuating
temperature. If she brings one more case off successfully,
she earns the diploma and the gold medal of the
Royal Therapeutical Society.</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  That’s right.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  And you would wish me to be that third
case, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  That’s the idea.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  And be cosseted back to health by her
ladyship?</p>

<p><span class="role">LATIMER</span>.  His lordship wishes to imply that not only
would your mental horizon be widened during the
period of convalescence, but that material blessings
would also flow. Isn’t that right, Leonard?</p>

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span>.  A commission on the gold medal.
Naturally.</p>

<p><span class="role">DOMINIC</span>.  I am sorry, sir. I am afraid I cannot see
my way.</p>

It’s the chance of a lifetime to learn all about the French

<p><span class="role">NICHOLAS</span> (<i>with a grin, as he goes</i>).  There’s an awfully

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>as he comes in</i>).  This way. (<i>He holds the

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>coming in</i>).  Thanks.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Some of the family will be showing up

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Thanks. (<i>He looks round the room with
interest, and sees the picture over the fireplace</i>) Hallo,
there he is.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  What? (<i>Bored</i>) Oh, the old ’un, yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>reverently</i>).  Oliver Blayds, the last of the
Victorians. (<span class="role">OLIVER</span> <i>sighs and looks despairingly to
Heaven</i>.) I can’t take my hat off because it’s off already,
but I should like to.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord, you don’t really feel like that,
do you?</p>

<p><a name="png.196" id="png.196" href="#png.196"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>182<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Of course. Don’t you?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, hardly. He’s my grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  True. (<i>Smiling</i>) All the same, there’s nothing
in the Ten Commandments about <em>not</em> honouring your
grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Nothing about honouring ’em either. It’s
left optional. Of course, he’s a wonderful old fellow—ninety,
and still going strong; but—well, as I say, he’s
my grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I’m afraid, Conway, that even the fact of
his being your grandfather doesn’t prevent me thinking
him a very great poet, a very great philosopher, and
a very great man.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>interested</i>).  I say, do you really mean that,
or are you just quoting from the Address you’ve come
to present?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Well, it’s in the Address, but then I wrote
the Address, and got it up.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, I know—you told me—“To Oliver
Blayds on his ninetieth birthday: Homage from some
of the younger writers.” Very pretty of them and all
that, and the old boy will love it. But do they really
feel like that about him—that’s what interests me.
I’ve always thought of him as old-fashioned, early
Victorian, and that kind of thing.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, he is. Like Shakespeare. Early Elizabethan
and that kind of thing.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Shakespeare’s<!-- original reads "Shakepeare’s" --> different. I meant more like
Longfellow.... Don’t think I am setting up my
opinion against yours. If you say that Blayds’ poetry
is as good as the best, I’ll take your word for it. Blayds
the poet, <em>you’re</em> the authority. Blayds the grandfather,
<em>I</em> am.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  All right, then, you can take my word for
it that his best is as good as the best. Simple as

Swinburne.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, but what about the modern Johnnies?
The Georgians.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  When they’re ninety I’ll tell you. If I’m alive.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Thanks very much.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>There is a short silence.</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span> <i>leaves the picture
and comes slowly towards the writing-table</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).  Oh, no!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>turning round</i>).  What?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  That’s not the table where the great masterpieces
are written, and that’s not the pen they are
written with.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  My dear <span class="nw">fellow——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Is there a pen there, by the way?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>looking</i>).  Yes. Yours?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  The family’s. You’ve no idea how difficult
it is to keep pens there.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Why, where do they go to?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  The United States, mostly. Everybody
who’s let in here makes for the table sooner or later
and pinches one of the pens. “Lands’ sake, what a
head,” they say, waving at the picture with their right
hand and feeling behind their back with the left; it’s
wonderful to see ’em. Tim, my sister—Tim and I
glued a pen on to the tray once when one of ’em was
coming, and watched him clawing at it for about five
minutes, and babbling about the picture the whole time.
I should think he knew what the poet Blayds looked
like by the time he got the pen into his pocket.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>going back to the picture</i>).  Well, it’s a wonderful
head.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, I will say that for the old boy, he does
look like somebody.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  When was this done?</p>

<p><a name="png.198" id="png.198" href="#png.198"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>184<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oh, about eighteen years ago.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes. That was about when I met him.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You never told me you’d met him. Did
you meet <em>me</em> by any chance?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I was five then, and people who came to see
Blayds the poet patted the head of Blayds the poet’s
grandson and said: “Are you going to be a poet too,
my little man, when you grow up?”</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  And what did Blayds the poet’s
grandson say?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Urged on by Blayds the poet’s son-in-law,
Blayds the poet’s grandson offered to recite his grandfather’s
well-known poem, “A Child’s Thoughts on
Waking.” I’m sorry you missed it, Royce, but it’s no
good asking for it now.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>half to himself</i>).  It was at Bournemouth.
He was there with his daughter. Not your mother,
she would have been younger than that.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You mean Aunt Isobel.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Isobel, yes. (<i>After a little silence</i>) Isobel
Blayds. Yes, that was eighteen years ago. I was
about your age.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  A fine handsome young fellow like me?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Any grandfathers living?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Lucky devil. But I don’t suppose you
realised it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, I don’t think I realised it.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>thinking it out</i>).  I suppose if I had a famous
father I shouldn’t mind so much. I should feel that
it was partly my doing. I mean that he wouldn’t
have begun to be famous until I had been born. But
the poet Blayds was a world-wide celebrity long before
<a name="png.199" id="png.199" href="#png.199"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>185<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>I came on the scene, and I’ve had it hanging over me
ever since.... Why do you suppose I am a member
of the club?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Well, why not? It’s a decent club. We are
all very happy there.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, but why did they elect <em>me</em>?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, well, if we once began to ask ourselves
<span class="nw">that——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Not at all. The answer in your case is
because A. L. Royce is a well-known critic and a jolly
good fellow. The answer in my case is because there’s
a B. in both. In other words, because there’s a Blayds
in Blayds-Conway. If my father had stuck to his
William Conway when he got married, I should never
have been elected. Not at the age of twenty-two,
anyway.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Then I’m very glad he changed his name.
Because otherwise, it seems, I might not have had the
pleasure of meeting you.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oh, well, there’s always a something. But,
compliments aside, it isn’t much fun for a man when
things happen to him just because of the Blayds in
Blayds-Conway. You know what I am doing now,
don’t you? I told you.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Secretary to some politician, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes. And why? Because of the Blayds
<span class="nw">in——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, nonsense!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s true. Do you think I want to be a
private secretary to a dashed politician? What’s a
private secretary at his best but a superior sort of valet?
I wanted to be a motor engineer. Not allowed. Why
not? Because the Blayds in Blayds-Conway wouldn’t
have been any use. But politicians simply live on that
sort of thing.</p>

 class="ns">[</span>186<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What sort of thing?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Giving people jobs because they’re the
grandsons of somebody.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I wonder if I was as cynical as you
eighteen years ago.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Probably not; there wasn’t a Grandfather
Royce. By the way, talking about being jolly good
fellows and all that, have you noticed that I haven’t
offered you a cigarette yet?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I don’t want to smoke.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, that’s lucky. Smoking isn’t allowed
in here.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>annoyed by this</i>).  Now look here, Conway,
do you mind if I speak plainly?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Do. But just one moment before you
begin. My name, unfortunately, is <em>Blayds</em>-Conway.
Call me Conway at the Club and I’ll thank you for it.
But if you call me Conway in the hearing of certain
members of my family, I’m afraid there will be trouble.
Now what were you going to say?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>his annoyance gone</i>).  Doesn’t matter.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  No, do go on, Mr. Blayds-Royce.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Very well, Mr. Blayds-Conway. I am old
enough to be—no, not your grandfather—your uncle—and
I want to say this. Oliver Blayds is a very great
man and also a very old man, and I think that while
you live in the house of this very great man, the inconveniences
to which his old age puts you, my dear
<span class="nw">Conway——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Blayds-Conway.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Blayds-Conway, I’m sorry.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Perhaps you’d better call me Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I think I will. Well, then, <span class="nw">Oliver——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, but you’ve missed the whole point.
The whole point is that I don’t <em>want</em> to live in his house.

I brought you along this afternoon because you’d got
permission to come anyhow with that Address of yours.
But I shouldn’t have dared to bring anybody else along

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I’m afraid I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>defensively</i>).  It’s a beautiful poem.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  One of the homage merchants.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Miss Blayds-Conway, I appeal to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Anything I can do in return for your
<span class="nw">shilling——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I have come here on behalf of some of my
contemporaries, in order to acquaint that very great
man Oliver Blayds with the feelings of admiration
which we younger writers entertain for him. It
appears now that not only is Blayds a great poet and
a great philosopher, but also <span class="nw">a——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Great-grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  But also a grandfather. Do you think you
can persuade your brother that Blayds’ public reputation
as a poet is in no way affected by his private reputation
as a grandfather, and beg him to spare me any
further revelations?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Certainly; I could do all that for ninepence,
and you’d still be threepence in hand. (<i>Sternly
to</i> <span class="role">OLIVER</span>) Blayds-Conway, young fellow, have you been
making r-revelations about your ger-rand-father?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  My dear girl, I’ve made no r-revelations
whatever. What’s upset him probably is that I refused
to recite to him “A Child’s Thoughts on Waking.”</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Did he pat your head and ask you to?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Well, you needn’t be huffy about it,
Mr. Royce. You would have been in very good company.
Meredith and Hardy have, and lots of others.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, anyway, I’ve never been kissed by
Maeterlinck.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>looking down coyly</i>).  Mr. Royce, you have
surprised my secret, which I have kept hidden these
seventeen years. Maeterlinck—Maurice and <span class="nw">I——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Revelations was not quite the word. What
I should have said was that I have been plunged
suddenly, and a little unexpectedly, into an unromantic,
matter-of-fact atmosphere, which hardly suits the
occasion of my visit. On any other day—you see what
I mean, Miss Septima.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  You’re quite right. This is not the occasion
for persiflage. Besides, we’re very proud of him
really.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I’m sure you are.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>weightily</i>).  You know, Noll, there are
times when I think that possibly we have misjudged
Blayds.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Blayds the poet or Blayds the man?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Blayds the man. After all, Uncle Thomas
was devoted to him, and <em>he</em> was rather particular.
Wasn’t he, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I don’t think I know your Uncle Thomas,
do I?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  He wasn’t mine, he was mother’s.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  The Sage of Chelsea.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, Carlyle. <span class="nw">Surely——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Mother called them all “uncle” in her day.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Well, now, there you are. That’s one of
the most charming things about Oliver Blayds. He has
always had a genius for friendship. Read the lives

We’re hopeless. Shall I tell you why?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  When you were a child, did you ever get
the giggles in church?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Almost always—when the Vicar wasn’t
looking.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  There’s something about it, isn’t there—the
solemnity of it all—which starts you giggling?
When the Vicar isn’t looking.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Exactly. And that’s why <em>we</em> giggle—when

will look after his friend. I’m sure you’ll understand,
Mr.—<span class="nw">er——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, quite. Of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Mr. Royce has come to see Grandfather,
Mother.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>appalled</i>).  To see Grandfather!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I was hoping—Mr. Blayds-Conway was good
enough to <span class="nw">say——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I am afraid it is quite impossible. I am
very sorry, but really quite impossible. My son
shouldn’t have held out hopes.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  He didn’t. You’re barking up the wrong
tree, Mother. It’s Father who invited him.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I am here on behalf of certain of my <span class="nw">contemporaries——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Homage from some of our younger
<span class="nw">writers——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Mr. Blayds was gracious enough to indicate
<span class="nw">that——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>in a violent whisper</i>).  A. L. Royce, Mother!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh! Oh, I beg your pardon. Why didn’t
you tell me it was A. L. Royce, Oliver? Of course!
We wrote to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>all hospitality</i>).  How silly of me! You
must forgive me, Mr. Royce. Oliver ought to have
told me. Grandfather—Mr. Blayds—will be ready at
three-thirty. The doctor was very anxious that Grandfather
shouldn’t see any one this year—outside the
family, of course. I couldn’t tell you how many people
wrote asking if they could come to-day. Presidents of
Societies and that sort of thing. From all over the
world. Father did tell us. Do you remember, Septima?</p>

didn’t believe it.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span>). Septima—after the poem, you
know. “Septima, seventh dark <span class="nw">daughter——”</span> (<i>And
she would quote the whole of it, but that her children interrupt.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>solemnly</i>).  Don’t say you’ve never heard
of it, Royce.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>distressed</i>).  I don’t believe he has.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>encouragingly</i>).  You must read it. I think
you’d like it.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  It’s one of his best known. <cite>The Times</cite>
quoted it only last week. We had the cutting.
“Septima, seventh dark <span class="nw">daughter——”</span> It was a
favourite of my husband’s even before he married me.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  It has been a favourite of mine for many
years.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  And many other people’s, I’m sure. We
often get letters—Oh, if you could see the letters we
get!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I wonder you don’t have a secretary.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).  My husband—Mr. Blayds-Conway—<em>is</em>
Grandfather’s secretary. He was appointed
to the post soon after he married me. Twenty-five
years ago. There is almost nothing he mightn’t have
done, but he saw where his duty lay, and he has devoted
himself to Grandfather—to Mr. Blayds—ever since.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I am sure we are all grateful to him.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Grandfather, as you know, has refused a
Peerage more than once. But I always say that if
devotion to duty counts for anything, William, my
husband, ought to have been knighted long ago.
Perhaps when Grandfather has passed <span class="nw">away——</span> But
there!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I was telling Oliver that I did meet
Mr. Blayds once—and Miss Blayds. Down at Bournemouth.
<a name="png.207" id="png.207" href="#png.207"><span class="pagenum"><span

well at the time.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, Isobel, yes. A wonderful nurse. I
don’t know what Grandfather would do without her.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  She is <span class="nw">still——?</span> I thought perhaps she
was married, <span class="nw">or——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, no! Isobel isn’t the marrying sort. I
say that I don’t know what Grandfather would do
without her, but I might almost say that I don’t know
what she would do without Grandfather. (<i>Looking at
her watch</i>) Dear me, I promised Father that I would
get those letters off. Septima, dear, you must help me.
Have you been round the house at all, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, I’ve only just come.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  There are certain rooms which are shown
to the public. Signed photographs, gifts from Tennyson,
Ruskin, Carlyle and many others. Illuminated
addresses and so on, all most interesting. Oliver,
perhaps you would show Mr. Royce—if it would interest
<span class="nw">you——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, indeed, yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oliver!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>throwing down the book he was looking at</i>). 
Right. (<i>He gets up.</i>) Come on, Royce. (<i>As they go
out</i>) There’s one thing that I can show you, anyway.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What’s that?</p>

<p class="closeup"><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>violently</i>).  My bedroom. We’re allowed to
smoke there.</p>         <p class="rt">[<i>They go out.</i></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>sitting down at the writing-table</i>).  He seems
a nice man. About thirty-five, wouldn’t you say—or

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Forty. But you never can tell with men.

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>thinking her own thoughts</i>).  Mother!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear? (<i>Writing</i>) Doctor John
Treherne.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I want to speak to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Do you mean about anything important?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  For me, yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  You haven’t annoyed your grandfather,
I hope.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  It has nothing to do with Grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Beechcroft, Bexhill-on-Sea. We’ve been so
busy all day. Naturally, being the Birthday. Couldn’t
you leave it till to-morrow, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>eagerly</i>).  Rita Ferguson wants me to share
rooms with her. You know I’ve always wanted to,
and now she’s just heard of some; there’s a studio
goes with it. On Campden Hill.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear. We’ll see what Grandfather says.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>annoyed</i>).  I said that this has nothing to
do with Grandfather. We’re talking about <em>me</em>. It’s
no good trying to do anything here, <span class="nw">and——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  There! I’ve written <em>Campden</em> Hill; how
stupid of me. <em>Haverstock</em> Hill. We’ll see what Grandfather
says, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>doggedly</i>).  It has nothing to do with Grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>outraged</i>).  Septima!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  “We’ll see what Grandfather says”—that
has always been the answer to everything in this house.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>as sarcastically as she can, but she is not very
good at it</i>).  You can hardly have forgotten who Grandfather
is.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I haven’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I said that I hadn’t forgotten what Grandfather
<em>is</em>. You’re telling me what he <em>was</em>. He <em>is</em> an
old man of ninety. I’m twenty. Anything that I do
will affect him for at most five years. It will affect
me for fifty years. That’s why I say this has nothing
to do with Grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>distressed</i>).  Septima, sometimes you almost
seem as if you were irreligious. When you think who
Grandfather is—and his birthday too. (<i>Weakly</i>) You
must talk to your father.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  That’s better. Father’s only sixty.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  You must talk to your father. He will

It’s always the way.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>plaintively</i>).  I really don’t understand you

off my allowance if I just went.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Went?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes. Would he? It would be beastly
unfair, of course, but I suppose he would.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>at the end of her resources</i>).  Septima, you’re
<em>not</em> to talk like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I think I’ll get Aunt Isobel to tackle
Grandfather. She’s only forty. Perhaps <em>she</em> could

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  That’s right. And then you might help
your mother to entertain Mr. Royce until we send for
him. Perhaps we might—wait a <span class="nw">moment——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, have you seen Mr. Royce, William?
He seems a nice young man, doesn’t he? I’m sure
Grandfather will like him.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>pontifically</i>).  I still think that it was very
unwise of us to attempt to see anybody to-day. Naturally
I made it clear to Mr. Royce what a very unexpected
departure this is from our usual practice. I fancy that
he realises the honour which we have paid to the younger
school of writers. Those who are knocking at the door,
so to speak.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, I’m sure he does.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes, Father. (<i>As she goes</i>) What fun he’s
going to have!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Are those the letters?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear, I’ve nearly finished them.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  They will do afterwards. (<i>Handing her a

Isobel is seeing about the flowers?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, yes, sure to be, dear. How do you
mean, sort them?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  In three groups will be best. Those from
societies or public bodies, those from distinguished
people, including Royalty—you will find one from the
Duchess there; her Royal Highness is very faithful to
us—and those from unknown or anonymous admirers.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh, yes, I see, dear. (<i>She gets to work.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  He will like to know who have remembered
him. I fancy that we have done even better than we
did on the eightieth birthday, and of course the day
is not yet over. (<i>He walks about the room importantly,
weighing great matters in his mind. This is his day.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>frowning anxiously</i>).  What did we do last
year about drinking the health? Was it in here, or
did we go to his room?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  He was down to lunch last year. Don’t
you remember, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Ah, yes, of course. Stupid of me. Yes,
this last year has made a great difference to him. He
is breaking up, I fear. We cannot keep him with us

want a rough grouping. We shall have a general

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>doubtfully</i>).  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Or was that later? I had an Aberdeen
before that.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, that was it, I think.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Thomas.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Thomas. Yes.... Only eighteen
little years ago. But what worlds away. Just give
me that tune again. (<i>He gives it to her, and the memories
stir again.</i>) You had a pipe you were very proud of—with
a cracked bowl—and a silver band to keep
it together. What silly things one remembers ...
you’d forgotten it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I remember that pink cotton dress.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Eighty years ago. Or is it only eighteen?
<a name="png.216" id="png.216" href="#png.216"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>202<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>And now we meet again. You married? I seem to
remember hearing.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>uncomfortably</i>).  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I hope it was happy.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No. We separated.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I am sorry.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Was it likely it would be?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Was that all the chance of happiness
you gave her?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You think I oughtn’t to have married?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh, my dear, who am I to order people’s
lives?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You ordered mine.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>ignoring this</i>).  But you <em>have</em> been happy?
Marriage isn’t everything. You have been happy in
your work, in your books, in your friends?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>after thinking</i>).  Yes, Isobel, on the whole,
yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I’m glad.... (<i>She holds out her hand suddenly
with a smile</i>) How do you do, Mr. Royce? (<i>She
is inviting him to step off the sentimental footing.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>stepping off</i>).  How do you do, Miss Blayds?
It’s delightful to meet you again.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Let’s sit down; shall we? (<i>They sit down
together.</i>) My father will be coming in directly. You
are here to see him, of course?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes. Tell me about him—or rather about
yourself. You are still looking after him?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  For eighteen years.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Nearly twenty altogether.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  And has it been worth it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He has written wonderful things in those
twenty years. Not very much, but very wonderful.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, that has always been the miracle about
<a name="png.217" id="png.217" href="#png.217"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>203<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>him, the way he has kept his youth. And the fire and
spirit of youth. You have helped him there.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>proudly</i>).  Has it been worth it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>puzzled</i>).  I don’t know. It’s difficult to say.
The world would think so; but I—naturally I am
prejudiced.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  You might have looked after <em>me</em>
for those eighteen years.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Did you want it as much as he? (<i>As he
protests</i>) No, I don’t mean “want” it—need it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Well, that’s always the problem, isn’t it—whether
the old or the young have the better right to
be selfish. We both needed you, in different ways.
You gave yourself to him, and he has wasted your life.
I don’t think <em>I</em> should have wasted it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I am proud to have helped him. No one
will know. Everything which he wrote will be his.
Only <em>I</em> shall know how much of it was mine. Well,
that’s something. Not wasted.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Sacrificed.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Am I to regret that?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Do you regret it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>after considering</i>).  When you asked me to
marry you I—I couldn’t. He was an old man then;
he wanted me; I was everything to him. Oh, he has
had his friends, more friends than any man, but he
had to be the head of a family too, and without me—I’ve
kept him alive, active. He has sharpened his
brains on me. (<i>With a shrug</i>) On whom else?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I understand that.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You wouldn’t have married me and come to
live with us all, as Marion and William have done?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, no, that’s death.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, I knew you felt like that. But I
<a name="png.218" id="png.218" href="#png.218"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>204<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>couldn’t leave him. (<span class="role">ROYCE</span> <i>shrugs his shoulders unconvinced</i>.)
Oh, I <em>did</em> love you then; I <em>did</em> want to
marry you! But I couldn’t. He wasn’t just an
ordinary man—you must remember that, please. He
was Blayds.... Oh, what are we in the world for
but to find beauty, and who could find it as he, and
who could help him as I?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I was ready to wait.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Ah, but how could we? Until he died!
Every day you would be thinking, “I wonder how he
is to-day,” and I should be knowing that you were
thinking that. Oh, horrible! Sitting and waiting for
his death.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>thoughtfully, recognising her point of view</i>). 
Yes.... Yes.... But if you were back now, knowing
what you know, would you do it again?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I think so. I think it has been worth it.
It isn’t fair to ask me. I’m glad now that I have given
him those eighteen years, but perhaps I should have
been afraid of it if I had known it was to be as long
as that. It has been trying, of course—such a very
old man in body, although so young in mind—but it
has not been for an old man that I have done it; not
for a selfish father; but for the glorious young poet
who has never grown up, and who wanted me.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>looking into her soul</i>).  But you have had your
bad moments.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>distressed</i>).  Oh, don’t! It isn’t fair.</p>

<p class="hang">
(<span class="role">ROYCE</span>, <i>his eyes still on her, begins the refrain again</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling sadly</i>).  Oh, no, Mr. Royce! That’s
all over. I’m an old woman now.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>rather ashamed</i>).  I’m sorry.... Yes, you’re
older now.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Twenty and thirty-eight—there’s a world of
difference between them.</p>

<p><a name="png.219" id="png.219" href="#png.219"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>205<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I’m forty.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Don’t ask me to pity you. What’s
forty to a man?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You’re right. In fact I’m masquerading here
to-day as one of the younger writers.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>glad to be off the subject of herself</i>).  Father
likes to feel that he is admired by the younger writers.
So if you’ve brought all their signatures with you, he’ll
be pleased to see you, Mr. Royce. I had better give
you just one word of warning. Don’t be too hard on
the 1863 volume.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I shan’t even mention it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  But if <em>he</em> <span class="nw">does——?</span> It has been attacked
so much that he has a sort of mother-love for it now,
and even I feel protective towards it, and want to say,
“Come here, darling, nobody loves you.” Say something
kind if you can. Of course I know it isn’t his
best, but when you’ve been praised as much as he, the
little praise which is withheld is always the praise you
want the most.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  How delightfully human that sounds. That
is just what I’ve always felt in my own small way.</p>

<p class="grandentrance">
<span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>comes fussily in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Is <span class="nw">Mr. Royce——?</span> Ah, there you are!

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh, yes, thanks.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  That’s right. Isobel—(<i>he looks, in a statesmanlike

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  How is he just now?</p>

After that, we shall all drink the health—you will join

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Certainly.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Then, of course, it depends how we are

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  What are you doing?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Just finishing off a few letters, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Would you be good enough to bring me my
Sordello?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The one which Browning gave you, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Of course. I wish to show Mr. Royce the
inscription—(<i>to</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span>)—an absurd one, all rhymes to
Blayds. It will be in the library somewhere; it may
have got moved.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Certainly, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  <span class="nw">Father——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>holding up a hand to stop her</i>).  Thank you,
William. (<i>William goes out.</i>) You were saying,
Isobel?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Nothing. I thought it was in your bedroom.
I was reading to you last night.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>sharply</i>).  Of course it’s in my bedroom. But
can’t I get my own son-in-law out of the room if I want
to?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>soothingly</i>).  Of course, dear. It was silly of
me.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  My son-in-law, Mr. Royce, meditates after
my death a little book called “Blaydsiana.” He hasn’t
said so, but I see it written all over him. In addition,
you understand, to the official life in two volumes.
There may be another one called “On the Track of
Blayds in the Cotswolds,” but I am not certain of this
yet. (<i>He chuckles to himself.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>reproachfully</i>).  Father!</p>

<p><a name="png.226" id="png.226" href="#png.226"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>212<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>apologetically</i>).  All right, Isobel. Mr. Royce
won’t mind.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling reluctantly</i>).  It’s very unkind.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  You never knew Whistler, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, sir; he was a bit before my time.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Ah, he was the one to say unkind things.
But you forgave him because he had a way with him.
And there was always the hope that when he had
finished with <em>you</em>, he would say something still worse
about one of your friends. (<i>He chuckles to himself again.</i>)
I sent him a book of mine once—which one was it,
Isobel?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  <em>Helen.</em></p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  <em>Helen</em>, yes. I got a postcard from him a
few days later: “Dear Oliver, rub it out and do it
again.” Well, I happened to meet him the next day,
and I said that I was sorry I couldn’t take his advice,
as it was too late now to do anything about it. “Yes,”<!-- punctuation invisible -->
said Jimmie, “as God said when he’d made Swinburne.”</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You’ve heard that, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No. Ought I to have?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It has been published.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>wickedly</i>).  I told my son-in-law. Anything
which I tell my son-in-law is published.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I always say that father made it up.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  You didn’t know Jimmie, my dear. There
was nothing he couldn’t have said. But a most stimulating
companion.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, he must have been.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  So was Alfred. He had a great sense of
humour. All of us who knew him well knew that.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  It is curious how many people nowadays
regard Tennyson as something of a prig, with no sense
of humour. I always feel that his association with
<a name="png.227" id="png.227" href="#png.227"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>213<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Queen Victoria had something to do with it. A Court
poet is so very un-stimulating.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  I think you’re right. It was a pity. (<i>He
chuckles to himself.</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span> <i>waits expectantly</i>.) I went to
Court once.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  You?</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>nodding</i>).  Yes, I went to Osborne to see the
Queen. Alfred’s doing I always suspected, but he
wouldn’t own to it. (<i>He chuckles.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Tell him about it, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  I had a new pair of boots. They squeaked.
They squeaked all the way from London to the Isle of
Wight. The Queen was waiting for me at the end
of a long room. I squeaked in. I bowed. I squeaked
my way up to her. We talked. I was not allowed to
sit down, of course; I just stood shifting from one foot
to the other—and squeaking. She said: “Don’t you
think Lord Tennyson’s poetry is very beautiful?” and
I squeaked and said, “Damn these boots!” A gentleman-in-waiting
told me afterwards that it was contrary
to etiquette to start a new topic of conversation with
Royalty—so I suppose that that is why I have never
been asked to Court again.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It was your joke, Father, not the gentleman-in-waiting’s.
(<span class="role">BLAYDS</span> <i>chuckles</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I’m sure of that.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Isobel knows all my stories.... When
you’re ninety, they know all your stories.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I like hearing them again, dear, and
Mr. Royce hasn’t heard them.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  I’ll tell you one you <em>don’t</em> know, Isobel.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Not you.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Will you bet?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It’s taking your money.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Mr. Royce will hold the stakes. A shilling.</p>

<p><a name="png.228" id="png.228" href="#png.228"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>214<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You will be ruined. (<i>She takes out her
purse.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>childishly</i>).  Have you got one for me too?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>taking out two</i>).  One for you and one for me.
Here you are, Mr. Royce.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Thank you. Both good ones? Right.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  George Meredith told me this. Are you
fond of cricket, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, very.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  So was Meredith, so was I.... A young
boy playing for his school. The important match of
the year; he gets his colours only if he plays—you
understand? Just before the game began, he was
sitting in one of those—what do they call them?—deck
chairs, when it collapsed, his hand between the hinges.
Three crushed fingers; no chance of playing; no
colours. At that age a tragedy; it seems that one’s
whole life is over. You understand?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes. Oh, very well.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  But if once the match begins with him, he
has his colours, whatever happens afterwards. So he
decides to say nothing about the fingers. He keeps his
hand in his pocket; nobody has seen the accident, nobody
guesses. His side is in first. He watches—his
hand is in his pocket. When his turn comes to bat, he
forces a glove over the crushed fingers and goes to
the wickets. He makes nothing—well, that doesn’t
matter; he is the wicket-keeper and has gone in last.
But he knows now that he can never take his place in
the field; and he knows, too, what an unfair thing he
has done to his school to let them start their game with
a cripple. It is impossible now to confess.... So,
in between the innings, he arranges another accident
with his chair, and falls back on it, with his fingers—his
already crushed fingers this time—in the hinges.
<a name="png.229" id="png.229" href="#png.229"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>215<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>So nobody ever knew. Not until he was a man, and it
all seemed very little and far away.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What a horrible story! Give him the
money, Mr. Royce.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Keep it for me, Isobel. (<span class="role">ISOBEL</span> <i>takes it</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Is it true, sir?</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  So Meredith said. He told me.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Lord, what pluck! I think I should have
forgiven him for that.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Yes, an unfair thing to do; but having done
it, he carried it off in the grand manner.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  To save himself.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span>.  Well, well. But he had qualities. Don’t
you think so, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I do indeed.</p>

<p class="hang">
(<i>There is a silence. The excitement of the occasion
has died away, and you can almost see</i> <span class="role">BLAYDS</span>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).  I could tell you another
story, Isobel, which you don’t know.... Of another

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Not now, dear. You mustn’t tire yourself.</p>

<p><span class="role">BLAYDS</span> (<i>a very old man suddenly</i>).  No, not now. But
I shall tell you one day. Yes, I shall have to tell you....

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> <i>comes in dressed in the deepest black, having just
returned from the funeral of</i> <span class="role">OLIVER BLAYDS</span>. <i>He
looks round the room, and then up at the old gentleman

</div>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>blowing out smoke</i>).  Ah!</p>

<p class="grandentrance"><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> <i>comes in</i>.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>seeing the cigarette</i>).  Hallo!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>a little on the defensive</i>).  Hallo!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I think I’ll join you. Got one?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I expect so. (<i>He offers her one.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Thanks. (<i>He lights it for her.</i>) Thanks.
(<i>She also takes her first deep breath.</i>) Well, that’s that.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  What did you think of it?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  It’s rather awful, isn’t it? I mean awe-inspiring.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes. I don’t know why it should be. Did
you cry? You looked like it once or twice.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes. Not because it was Grandfather.
Not because it was Oliver Blayds. But—just because.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Because it was the last time.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes.... I suppose that’s why one cries
<a name="png.233" id="png.233" href="#png.233"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>219<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>at weddings. Or at—no, I’ve never been to a christening.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You have. And I bet you cried.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Oh, my own, yes....</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Wonderful crowd of people. I don’t think
I ever realised before what a great man he was.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  No, one doesn’t....</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).  You know there’s a lot of rot
talked about death.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  A lot of rot talked about everything.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Here was Oliver Blayds—the greatest man
of his day—seen everything, known everybody, ninety
years old, honoured by all—and then he goes out.
Well!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Nothing is here for tears, in fact.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Not only nothing for tears, but everything
for rejoicings. I don’t understand these religious
people. They’re quite certain that there’s an after life,
and that this life is only a preparation for it—like a
cold bath in the morning to the rest of the day. And
yet they are always the people who make the most
fuss, and cover themselves with black, and say, “Poor
Grandfather!” ever after. Why poor? He is richer
than ever according to them.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Can’t you <em>see</em> Oliver Blayds in Heaven
enjoying it all? What poetry he would make of it!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  “A Child’s Thoughts on Waking”—eh?
I’ve laughed at it, and loathed it, but it was the real
stuff, you know. What’s the text—“Except ye be born
again as a little child, ye shall not enter into the kingdom
of Heaven”—is that right? <em>His</em> thoughts—on
waking in Heaven.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>thoughtfully</i>).  Septima Blayds-Conway. It’s
rather a thing to be, you know.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I used to think once that, when the old boy
<a name="png.234" id="png.234" href="#png.234"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>220<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>died, I’d chuck the Blayds and just be plain Oliver
Conway. I’m beginning to think I was wrong....
Oliver Blayds-Conway.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  The well-known statesman. Sorry—I mean
engineer.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, I wonder about that.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  What sort of wondering?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Things will be a bit different now. I’m the
only genuine Blayds <span class="nw">left——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Oh, indeed!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You know what I mean—male Blayds. And
it’s rather up to me not to let the old man down. Oliver
Blayds-Conway, M.P. There’s something in it, you
know. I was thinking about it in the church. Or
should I drop the Conway and just be Blayds? Or
Conway Blayds and drop the Oliver? It’s a bit of a
problem.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I shall keep the Blayds when I marry.
Drop the Conway, of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s a dirty game, politics, but that’s all the
more reason why there should be some really good
people in it. Irreproachable people, I mean. Conway
Blayds.... (<i>And the Duke of Devonshire, and so
forth</i>).</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>after a pause</i>).  I wonder what Aunt Isobel
wants to talk to us all about.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  The old man’s last dying instructions or
something. I was rather hoping to get down to the
Oval. I’ve got the day off. Bit of a change to go to
the Oval when you really <em>have</em> buried your grandfather.
But perhaps I ought to be careful if I’m going
in seriously for politics.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Noll, have you realised that it’s all going
to be rather interesting now?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Of course it is. But why particularly?</p>

<p><a name="png.235" id="png.235" href="#png.235"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>221<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Father.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You mean he’s lost his job.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes. It’s terribly exciting when your
father’s out of work.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  He’ll have more work than ever. He’ll
write Blayds’ life. That’ll take him years.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes; but, don’t you see, he hasn’t any
real standing now. Who is he? Only Blayds’ late
secretary. Whose house is this now, do you think?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Depends how the old man left it.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Of course it does. But you can be quite
sure he didn’t leave it to father. I think it’s all going
to be rather exciting.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, you won’t be here to see it, my
child.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Why not?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I thought you were going to live with that
Ferguson girl.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Not so sure now. There’s no hurry anyway.
I think I’ll wait here a bit, and see what
happens. It’s all going to be so different.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It is. (<i>He smiles at his thoughts.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  What?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>smiling broadly</i>).  It’s just on the cards that
it’s my house now. (<i>Looking round the room.</i>) I don’t
think I shall let father smoke in here.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  What fun that would be!... I hope he’s
left Aunt Isobel something.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, poor dear, she’s rather in the air, isn’t
she?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  It’s funny how little we know <em>her</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  We’ve hardly ever seen her, apart from the
old man. I don’t suppose there’s much to know. A
born nurse, and that’s all there is to it.</p>

been going on since</i> <span class="role">BLAYDS</span> <i>died</i>).  I say again, Oliver
Blayds ought to have been buried in the Abbey. The
nation expected it. The nation had the right to it.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear, but we couldn’t go against his
own wish. His last wish.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  If it was his wish, why did he not express
it to me?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  He told Isobel, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  So we are to believe. And of course I
was careful to let the public understand that this was
so in my letter to the <cite>Times</cite>. But in what circumstances
did he express the wish? (<i>He suddenly realises</i>
<span class="role">OLIVER’S</span> <i>cigarette and says sharply</i>) Oliver, you know
quite well that your <span class="nw">grandfather——</span> (<i>But then he
remembers where grandfather is.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>not understanding</i>).  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I think Father meant—of course Grandfather
can’t see you now—not to mind.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I should have thought your instinct would
have told you that this is hardly the moment, when
Oliver Blayds is just laid to <span class="nw">rest——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Your cigarette, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oh! (<i>He throws it away.</i>) Sorry, Mother,
if you mind. I didn’t think it would matter either way—now.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  That’s all right, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  As I was saying, in what circumstances did
he express the wish?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  What, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  On his death-bed, his faculties rapidly
going, he may have indicated preference for a simple
<a name="png.237" id="png.237" href="#png.237"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>223<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>ceremony. But certainly up to a few weeks of his
passing, although it was naturally a subject which I did
not care myself to initiate, he always gave me the
impression that he anticipated an interment in the
Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear. I daresay I shall feel it more
later, but just now I like to think of him where he
wanted to be himself.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  After all, Shakespeare isn’t buried in the
Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I don’t think that that has anything to
do with it, Septima. I am not saying that the reputation
of Oliver Blayds will suffer by reason of his absence
from the national Valhalla—he has built his own
monument in a thousand deathless lines; but speaking
as an Englishman, I say that the Abbey had a right to
him.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Well, it’s too late now, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I shall speak to Isobel again; I still feel
sure she was mistaken.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Very well, dear. But don’t worry her
more than you need. I feel rather uneasy about her.
She has been so strange since he died.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  She will be worried enough as it is. Of all
the extraordinary wills to make!</p>

<p class="rt">(<span class="role">OLIVER</span> <i>and</i> <span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> <i>exchange glances</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Why, what’s he done? We were wondering
about that.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Yes, yes, yes, you will know in good time,
my boy.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Why not now? This seems a very good
time.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Are we too young to be told?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>ignoring them</i>).  Marion, don’t let me forget
that message to the public—returning thanks for their
<a name="png.238" id="png.238" href="#png.238"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>224<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>sympathy, and so on. (<i>Moving to the desk.</i>) We might
draft that now.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Oliver was asking you about the will,
Father.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Yes, yes, another time. <span class="nw">Marion——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I suppose I am mentioned in it?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Of course, of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  To what extent?</p>

<p class="rt">(<span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>is too busy to answer</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Father, don’t be so childish.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>outraged</i>).  Septima!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Septima dear, you oughtn’t to talk to your
father like that.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>with dignity</i>).  I think you had better go to
your room.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>unmoved</i>).  But that’s the whole point. Is it
my room? (<span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>looks bewildered</i>.) Or is it Oliver’s,
or Mother’s, or Aunt Isobel’s?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I believe he has left everything to Aunt
Isobel.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Oh no, dear, he wouldn’t do that. He
would never have favourites. Share and share alike.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Half for you and half for Aunt Isobel?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Of course, dear. And all to you and Oliver
after our death. And something down to you now.
I forget how much. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">WILLIAM</span>) What was it, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>sulkily</i>).  A thousand pounds each.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Sportsman! What about you, Father?
Do you get anything?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Father gets a thousand too.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Then why “of all the extraordinary
<span class="nw">wills——”?</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  It’s because of Aunt Isobel being made sole
executor—literary executor too—isn’t that it, dear?</p>

<p><a name="png.239" id="png.239" href="#png.239"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>225<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>mumbling</i>).  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oho! Meaning that <em>she</em> runs Blayds now?
New editions, biographies, unpublished fragments, and
all the rest of it?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Naturally she will leave it in Father’s hands.
But, of course, Father is a little hurt that Grandfather
didn’t think of that for himself.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oh, well, I don’t suppose it matters much.
Then that’s why she wants to see us all now.</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>grunts assent; and stands up as</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>
<i>comes in</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Ah, here you are.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I’m sorry if I have kept you waiting.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  It’s all right, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I was just telling Marion that I am more
than ever convinced that Oliver Blayds’ rightful resting-place
was the Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>shaking her head wearily</i>).  No.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I was saying to Marion, even if he expressed
the wish in his last moments for a quiet <span class="nw">interment——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He never expressed the wish, one way or
the other.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  My dear Isobel! You distinctly told
<span class="nw">us——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  You did say, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, I owe you an apology about that.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).  An apology!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  There is something I have to tell you all.
Will you please listen, all of you? Won’t you sit down,
William? (<i>They sit down.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  What is it, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You’ve been very mysterious these last
few days.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I didn’t want to say anything until he had
<a name="png.240" id="png.240" href="#png.240"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>226<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>been buried. I shall not be mysterious now; I shall
be only too plain.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">OLIVER</span>). I say, what’s up?</p>

<p class="rt">(<span class="role">OLIVER</span> <i>shrugs his shoulders</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I told you that Father didn’t want to be
buried in the Abbey, not because he had said so, but
because it was quite impossible that he should be buried
in the Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Impossible!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I’m sure the Dean would have been <span class="nw">only——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Impossible because he had done nothing to
make him worthy of that honour.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oh no, Aunt Isobel, you’re wrong there. I
mean when you think of some of the <span class="nw">people——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Will you listen to me, please? And ask any
questions afterwards. You may think I’m mad; I’m
not.... I wish I were.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well, what is it?</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>She tells them; it is almost as if she were repeating
a lesson which she had learnt by heart.</i> <span class="role">BLAYDS</span>,
<i>you may be sure, made a story of it when he told
her—we seem to hear snatches of that story now</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Nearly seventy years ago there were two
young men, boys almost, twenty-three, perhaps, living
together in rooms in Islington. Both poor, both eager,
ambitious, certain of themselves, very certain of their
destiny. But only one of them was a genius. He was
a poet, this one; perhaps the greater poet because he
knew that he had not long to live. The poetry came
bubbling out of him, and he wrote it down feverishly,
quick, quick before the hand became cold and the fingers
could no longer write. That was all his ambition. He
had no thoughts of present fame; there was no time for
<a name="png.241" id="png.241" href="#png.241"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>227<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>it. He was content to live unknown, so that when dead
he might live for ever. His friend was ambitious in a
different way. He wanted the present delights of
fame. So they lived together there, one writing and
writing, always writing; the other writing and then
stopping to think how famous he was going to be, and
envying those who were already famous, and then
regretfully writing again. A time came when the poet
grew very ill, and lay in bed, but still writing, but still
hurrying, hurrying to keep pace with the divine music
in his brain. Then one day there was no more writing,
no more music. The poet was dead. (<i>She is silent for a
little.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>as her meaning slowly comes to him</i>).  Isobel,
what are you saying?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I don’t understand. Who was it?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>in the same quiet voice</i>).  The friend was left—with
the body of the poet—and all that great monument
which the dead man had raised for himself. The
poet had no friends but this one; no relations of whom
he had ever spoken or who claimed him now. He was
dead, and it was left to his friend to see that he won
now that immortality for which he had given his life....
His friend betrayed him.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I say!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I <em>won’t</em> believe it! It’s monstrous!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>wearily</i>).  One can see the temptation. There
he was, this young man of talent, of great ambition,
and there were these works of genius lying at his feet,
waiting to be picked up—and fathered by him. I
suppose that, like every other temptation, it came
suddenly. He writes out some of the verses, scribbled
down anyhow by the poet in his mad hurry, and sends
<a name="png.242" id="png.242" href="#png.242"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>228<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>them to a publisher; one can imagine the publisher’s
natural acceptance of the friend as the true author, the
friend’s awkwardness in undeceiving him, and then his
sudden determination to make the most of the opportunity
given him.... Oh, one can imagine many
things—but what remains? Always and always this.
That Oliver Blayds was not a poet; that he did not
write the works attributed to him; and that he betrayed
his friend. (<i>She stops and then says in an ordinary
matter-of-fact voice</i>) That was why I thought that he
ought not to be buried in the Abbey.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>sharply</i>).  Is this true, Isobel?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It isn’t the sort of story that I should make
up.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I don’t understand. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">WILLIAM</span>) What is
it? I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Isobel is telling us that Oliver Blayds stole
all his poetry from another man.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Stole it!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Passed it off as his own.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>firmly to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). Oh no, dear, you must
be wrong. Why should Grandfather want to steal anybody
else’s poetry when he wrote so beautifully himself?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  That’s just the point, Mother. Aunt
Isobel says that he didn’t write anything himself.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  But there are the books with his name on
them!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Stolen—from his friend.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>shocked</i>).  Isobel, how can you? Your own
father!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I don’t believe it. I had the privilege of
knowing Oliver Blayds for nearly thirty years and I
say that I don’t believe it.</p>

<p><a name="png.243" id="png.243" href="#png.243"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>229<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I knew him for some time too. He was my
father.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  When did he tell you this?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s a dashed funny thing <span class="nw">that——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  If you will allow me, Oliver. I want to
get to the bottom of this. When did he tell you?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  That last evening. His birthday.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  How? Why? Why should he tell you?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He seemed frightened suddenly—of dying.
I suppose he’d always meant to tell somebody before
he died.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Why didn’t you tell us before, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>holding up his hand</i>).  Please. Let me.
(<i>To</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>) Why didn’t you tell us before?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I promised not to say anything until he was
dead. Then I thought I would wait until he was
buried.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  You couldn’t have made a mistake? You
couldn’t have misunderstood him?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling sadly</i>).  No.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You say that this other man died—how
many years ago?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Sixty, seventy.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Ah! (<i>Sarcastically</i>) And sixty years after
he was dead he was apparently still writing poetry for
Oliver Blayds to steal?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He had already written it—sixty years ago—for
Oliver Blayds to steal.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord! What a man!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  You mean that his last <span class="nw">volume——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>holding up his hand</i>).  Please, Septima....
Take this last volume published when he was over
eighty. You say that everything there had been
written by this other man sixty years ago?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><a name="png.244" id="png.244" href="#png.244"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>230<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  And the manuscripts were kept by Oliver
Blayds for sixty years, written out again by him and
published in his old age as his own?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>triumphantly</i>).  And can you explain how
it was that he didn’t publish them earlier if he had
had them in his possession all those years?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He didn’t dare to. He was afraid of being
left with nothing to publish. He took care always to
have something in reserve. And that’s why everybody
said how wonderfully vigorous and youthful his mind
was at eighty, how amazing that the spirit and fire
of youth had remained with him so long. Yes, it was
the spirit and fire of youth, but of a youth who died
seventy years ago.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>impressed</i>).  Gad, you know, fancy the old
chap keeping it up like that. Shows how little one
really knows people. I had no idea he was such a
sportsman.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Such a liar.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Same thing, sometimes.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I call it perfectly disgusting.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Please, please! We shan’t arrive at the
truth like that. (<i>To</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>) You want me to understand
that Oliver Blayds has never written a line of his
own poetry in his life?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Why, Grandfather was always writing
poetry. Even as a child I <span class="nw">remember——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>impatiently</i>).  Mother, can’t you understand
that the Oliver Blayds we thought we knew never
existed?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  But I was telling you, dear, that even as a
<span class="nw">child——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">OLIVER</span>). It’s no good, she’s hopelessly
muddled.</p>

<p><a name="png.245" id="png.245" href="#png.245"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>231<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Yes, yes.... Do you wish me to <span class="nw">understand——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I wish you to know the truth. We’ve been
living in a lie, all of us, all our lives, and now at last
we have found the truth. You talk as if, for some
reason, I wanted to spread slanders about Oliver Blayds
now that he is dead; as if in some way all this great
lie were my doing; as if it were no pain but a sort of
a pleasure to me to find out what sort of man my
father really was. Ask me questions—I want you to
know everything; but don’t cross-examine me as if I
were keeping back the truth.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>upset and apologetic</i>).  Quite so, quite so.
It’s the truth which we want.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  As Grandfather said so beautifully himself
in his “Ode to Truth”—What are the lines?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>hopelessly</i>).  Oh, Mother!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, and that was what I was going to
say—could a man who wrote so beautifully about Truth
as Grandfather did tell lies and deceive people as
Isobel says he did? (<i>To</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>) I’m sure you must
have made a mistake, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You never told us—what was the other
fellow’s name?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I am coming to that directly. What I
am asking you now is this. Did Oliver Blayds write
no line of poetry himself at all?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  He wrote the 1863 volume.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>staggered</i>).  Oh!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  The wash-out? By Jove! Then <em>that</em> explains
it!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, that explains it. He tried to tell himself
that he was a poet too; that he had only used the
other man in order to give himself a start. So he
brought out a volume of his own poems. And then
<a name="png.246" id="png.246" href="#png.246"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>232<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>when everybody said “Blayds is finished,” he went back
hastily to his friend and never ventured by himself
again. And that explains why he resented the criticism
of that volume, why he was so pleased when it
was praised. It was all that he had written.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>defeated now</i>).  Yes, that would explain it.
(<i>To himself</i>) Oliver Blayds!...</p>

<p class="rt">(<i>They are all silent for a little.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Then he didn’t write “Septima.”</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Of course he didn’t. You’re illegitimate,
old girl.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Who did?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  The other man’s name was Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>in disgust</i>).  Christened after Jenkins!</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Oliver Jenkins-Conway, M.P. Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  It will have to be Oliver Conway now.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>gloomily</i>).  Yes, I suppose so. But everybody
will know.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>still fighting</i>).  His friends, Isobel. The
great friends he had had. The stories he has told us
about them—were those all lies too? No, they couldn’t

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, if it comes to that, <em>I</em> can <span class="nw">remember——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh, the friends were there. They accepted
him for what he seemed to be, just as we did. He
deceived them as cleverly as he deceived us.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Tennyson, Browning, <span class="nw">Swinburne——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>bitterly</i>).  Oh, he had his qualities. He talked
well. There were his books. Why should they doubt
him?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  He told her. She wouldn’t make it up.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  But there’s all that beautiful poetry. I’ve

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Oh, all right! But you don’t gain anything
by not being frank about it.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>The little storm dies down as suddenly as it began.

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord! I’ve just thought of something.
(<i>They look at him.</i>) The money.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The money?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  All this. (<i>He indicates the room</i>) Who does
it belong to?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  According to the provisions of your Grandfather’s
<span class="nw">will——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, but it wasn’t his to leave.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Not his <span class="nw">to——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  No, Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I thought we weren’t going to mention
Mr. Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Shut up, Tim, that’s different. (<i>To the
<a name="png.248" id="png.248" href="#png.248"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>234<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>others</i>) All the money comes from the books—at least
I suppose it does—and the books aren’t his, so the money
isn’t either.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>turning in a bewildered way to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). Is
that so?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>with a shrug</i>).  I suppose so.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You say he had no family, this other man.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  None who bothered about him. But there
must be relations somewhere.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  We shall have to find that out.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Anyhow, as Oliver says, the money isn’t
ours. (<i>Bitterly</i>) I wouldn’t touch a penny.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Some of the money would be rightfully his.
There was that one volume anyhow. It may not have
been praised, but it was bought. Then there’s the
question of his investments. It may prove that some
of his most profitable investments were made about
that time—with that very money. In which case, if
it could be <span class="nw">established——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>indignantly</i>).  Oh, how can you talk like that!
As if it mattered. It’s tainted money, all of it.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I think that is going too far. Very much
too far. I recognise, of course, that we have certain
obligations towards the relatives of this man—er—Jenkins.
Obviously we must fulfil those obligations.
But when that is <span class="nw">done——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). We shall be generous, of course,
dear, that’s only fair.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, but what are you going to do if no
relations turn up?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>turning doubtfully to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). Well, there is
that, of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  In that case we couldn’t do anything, could
we, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  We could throw the money into the sea; we
<a name="png.249" id="png.249" href="#png.249"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>235<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>could bury it deep in the ground; we could even give it
away, Marion.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  That’s going much too far.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s rather a problem, you know.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  It isn’t a problem at all. May I speak for
a moment? I really think I have a right to say something.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I want to say this. Oliver and I have been
brought up in a certain way to expect certain things.
Oliver wanted to be an engineer; he wasn’t allowed to,
as Grandfather wanted him to go into politics. I
wanted to share a studio with a friend and try and get
on with my painting; I wasn’t allowed to, as Grandfather
wanted me at home. Perhaps if Oliver had
been an engineer, he would have been doing well by
now. Perhaps if I had had my way, I might have
been earning my living by now. As it is, we have been
brought up as the children and grandchildren of rich
people; I can’t earn my own living, and Oliver is in
a profession in which money means success. Aunt
Isobel has been telling us how a young man of Oliver’s
age, seventy years ago, was cheated out of his rights.
Apparently she thinks that the best way now of making
up for that is to cheat Oliver and me out of our rights.
I don’t agree with her.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, there’s a good deal in that. Well done,
Tim.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It’s hard on you, I know. But you are
young; you still have your lives in front of you, to make
what you will of them.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  That’s what old people always say to
people of our age, and they seem to think that it excuses
any injustice.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Poor Grandfather!</p>

<p><a name="png.250" id="png.250" href="#png.250"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>236<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Yes, but I don’t see why it should be
“Poor Oliver” and “Poor Septima” too. Suppose any
relation did turn up—(<i>to</i> <span class="role">WILLIAM</span>)—suppose they do,
Father. Well, what will they all be? Grand-nephews,
or fifth cousins twice removed or something, who have
never heard of Jenkins, who never did anything <em>for</em>
Jenkins, and on whose lives Jenkins has had no effect
whatever. Is there any sort of justice which says that
they ought to have the money? But Noll and I have
given up a good deal for Oliver Blayds, and he owes us
something.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>with ironic sadness</i>).  Oh yes, you have given
up a good deal for Oliver Blayds. It ought to be paid
back to you.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>still trying to be fair</i>).  There’s another thing
we must remember. Even if this other <span class="nw">man——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Yes, even if he wrote all the books—always
excepting the 1863 volume—even so, it was
Oliver Blayds who arranged for their publication. He
could fairly claim, therefore, an agent’s commission on
all moneys received. Ten per cent.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>scornfully</i>).  Oliver Blayds, the well-known
commission agent!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Ten per cent of all moneys, therefore, is,
in any case, rightfully ours.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Only ten per cent, dear. That seems very
little.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I am working on a minimum basis. Isobel
says, “Throw all the money into the sea; it doesn’t belong
to us.” I say no, that is going too far. We have
one volume which is certainly ours. We have the ten
per cent commission which is certainly ours. There
may be other sums due to us, such as the profits of
certain of the investments. We can look into the
<a name="png.251" id="png.251" href="#png.251"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>237<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>matter carefully at our leisure. The great point, I
take it, is that we want to be fair to the relatives of this
man Jenkins, but also fair to the relatives of Oliver
Blayds, who, as Septima points out, have at least
done something to earn any money that comes to
them.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). We want to be fair to everybody,
dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Well, I think you are going to give the
Jenkinses much too much. What right have the Jenkinses
got to <em>any</em> of the money which Grandfather made
by investing?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, it was Jenkins’ money which was invested.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  We shouldn’t like to think of them starving
because we weren’t quite fair.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  They let Jenkins starve. They didn’t
worry about <em>him</em>.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Of course they didn’t, they weren’t even
born.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The whole question is extremely difficult.
We may require an arbitrator, or, at any rate, a qualified
chartered accountant.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Yes, that would be better, dear. To let
somebody else decide what is fair and what isn’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>in a low voice</i>).  Oh, it’s horrible ... horrible.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  What, dear?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  The way you talk—about the money. As
if all that we had lost was so much money. As if you
could estimate the wrong that Oliver Blayds did to
his friend in the terms of money. I said the money
was tainted. It is. How can you bear to touch it?
How can you bear to profit by such a betrayal?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  That’s pure sentiment, Aunt Isobel. Quite
apart from not being reasonable, it isn’t even practical.
<a name="png.252" id="png.252" href="#png.252"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>238<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>Where are you going to draw the line? If you’re going
to throw the money away, then you’ve got to throw the
house away and everything in the house away—all our
clothes to begin with. Because everything—everything
that belongs to us owes itself to that betrayal of seventy
years ago.... We should look very funny, the five
of us, walking out of the house to-morrow, with nothing
on, and starting life all over again.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Septima, dear, I don’t think that’s <span class="nw">quite——</span></p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> <i>begins to laugh to herself at the picture of
them</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  That isn’t fair, Tim. An extreme case
makes anything seem absurd. (<i>Earnestly to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>)
You know, I do see what you mean and I do sympathise.
But even if we kept all the money, would
that matter very much? All this man Jenkins wanted
was to leave an immortal name behind him. You’ve
just told us that nothing else interested him. Jenkins—I
don’t say it’s much of a name, but neither was
Keats for that matter. Well, Grandfather robbed him
of that, and a damned shame too, but now we are giving
it back to him. So all that’s happened is that he’s
had seventy years less immortality than he expected.
But he can’t worry seriously about that, any more than
Wordsworth can worry because he was born two
hundred years after Shakespeare. They are all equally
immortal.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). You see, dear, that’s quite fair
to everybody.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  One can’t argue about it; you feel it or you
don’t. And I give up my share of the money, so there
should be plenty for all of you, even after you have
been “fair” to the others.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>who has felt</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL’S</span> <i>scorn deeply</i>).  Isobel!
I don’t think you can realise how much you have hurt
<a name="png.253" id="png.253" href="#png.253"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>239<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>me by your words. After the first shock of your
revelation it has been my one object to keep my real
feelings, my very deep feelings, under control. I
suppose that this revelation, this appalling revelation,
has meant more to me than to any one in this room.
Put quite simply, it means the end of my life work,
the end of a career.... I think you know how I devoted
myself to Oliver <span class="nw">Blayds——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Simply devoted himself, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I gave up whatever other ambitions I may
have <span class="nw">had—</span></p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to the children</i>).  I always said that Father
could have done anything.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  —And I set myself from that day on to
live for one thing only, Oliver Blayds. It was a great
pride to me to be his son-in-law, a great pride to be his
secretary, but the greatest pride of all was the thought
that I was helping others to know and to love, as I
knew and loved him, that very great poet, that very
great man, Oliver Blayds. You tell me now that he
is—(<i>he snaps his fingers</i>)—nothing. A hollow mask.
(<i>His voice rises</i>) I think I have some right to be angry;
I think I have some right to bear resentment against
this man who has tricked me, who has been making
a fool of me for all these years. When I think of the
years of labour which I have spent already in getting
the materials together for this great man’s life; when
I think how I have listened to him and taken down
eagerly his every word; when I think that to-morrow
I am to be held up to the derision of the world for the
gullible fool I have shown myself to be, I think I have
a right to be angry. (<i>With a great effort he controls
himself and goes on more quietly</i>) But I have tried to
control my feelings. I have remembered that he was
your father and Marion’s father, and I have tried to
<a name="png.254" id="png.254" href="#png.254"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>240<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>control myself. To forget my own feelings, and to
consider only how best to clear up this wreckage that
Oliver Blayds has left behind. It is not for you to
scorn me, me who have been the chief one to suffer.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Poor Father! (<i>She puts out a hand.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>patting it</i>).  That’s all right. I don’t want
pity. I just want Isobel to try to realise what it means
to me.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes, by Jove, it is a bit rough on the governor.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Rough on all of us.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  But your father has suffered most. You
must always remember that.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Poor William! Yes, it is hard on you.
Your occupation’s gone.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  It is a terrible blow to us all, this dreadful
news that you have given us. But you can understand
that to me it is absolutely crushing.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>in a whisper</i>).  And to me? (<i>They look at her
in surprise.</i>) What has it been to me?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well, as I was <span class="nw">saying——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You have enjoyed your life here, yes, every
moment of it. If you hadn’t been secretary to Oliver
Blayds, you would have been secretary to somebody
else—it’s what you’re best fitted for. Yes, you have
lived your life; you have had interests, a hundred interests
every day to keep you active and eager....
(<i>Almost to herself</i>) But I say, what of me? What has
my life been? Look at me now—what am I?—a
wasted woman. I might have been a wife, a mother—with
a man of my own, children of my own, in my own
home. Look at me now...!</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  My dear, I never <span class="nw">dreamt——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>eighteen years away from them all</i>).  He asked
me to marry him. Tall and straight and clean he was,
and he asked me to marry him. Ah, how happy we
<a name="png.255" id="png.255" href="#png.255"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>241<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>should have been together, he and I—should we not
have been happy? He asked me to marry him.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Isobel!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Such a long time ago. I was young then,
and pretty then, and the world was very full then of
beautiful things. I used to laugh then—we laughed
together—such a gay world it was all those years ago.
And he asked me to marry him.... (<i>In a hard voice</i>)
I didn’t. I sent him away. I said that I must stay
with my father, Oliver Blayds, the great poet. Yes,
I was helping the great poet. (<i>With a bitter laugh</i>)
Helping!... And I sent my man away.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span> (<i>distressed</i>).  Oh, don’t!</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You thought I liked nursing. “A born
nurse”—I can hear you saying it. (<i>Fiercely it bursts out
after all these years</i>) I hated it! Do you know what it’s
like nursing a sick old man—day after day, night after
night? And then year after year. Always a little
older, a little more difficult. Do you know what it is to
live with an old man when you are young, as I was young
once, to live always with old age and never with youth,
and to watch your own youth gradually creeping up to
join his old age? Ah, but I was doing it for Blayds, for
the sake of his immortal poetry. (<i>She laughs—such a
laugh</i>) And look at me now, all wasted. The wife I
might have been, the mother I might have been. (<i>In a
whisper</i>) How beautiful the world was, all those years
ago!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Your intrinsic qualities.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I’m afraid they are not intrinsic enough in
the present state of the market.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Well, you said you wanted to be a motor
engineer—now’s your chance.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Helpful fellow, Royce. Now, as he says,
is my chance. (<i>There is a pause and then he says suddenly</i>)
I say, what do <em>you</em> think about it all?</p>

<p><a name="png.258" id="png.258" href="#png.258"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>244<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What do you mean, think about it all?
What is there to think? One tries not to think. It’s—shattering.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  No, I don’t mean that. I mean—do you
really think he did it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Did what?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Did <em>it</em>. Did Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I don’t understand. Is there any doubt about
it?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, that’s just it.... The fact is, I had
a brain-wave at Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Oh?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Yes. Quite suddenly it flashed across me,
and I said, “By Jove! Of course! That’s it!”</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What’s what?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  He never did it! He just imagined it! It
was all—what was the word I used?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Hallucination?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Hallucination. (<i>He nods</i>) That’s the word.
I wrote to Father last night. I said, “Hallucination.”
You can back it both ways, Royce, and you won’t be
far out.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I can see how attractive the word must
have looked—up at Bradford.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You don’t think it looks so well down
here?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I’m afraid not.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, why not? Which is more probable,
that Oliver Blayds carried out this colossal fraud for
more than sixty years, or that when he was an old
man of ninety his brain wobbled a bit, and he started
imagining things?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>shaking his head regretfully</i>).  No.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s all very well to say “No.” Anybody
can say “No.” As the Old Man said yesterday, you
<a name="png.259" id="png.259" href="#png.259"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>245<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>refuse to face the facts, Royce. Look at all the Will
cases you see in the papers. Whenever an old gentleman
over seventy leaves his money to anybody but his
loving nephews and nieces, they always bring an action
to prove that he can’t have been quite right in the head
when he died; and nine times out of ten they win.
Well, Blayds was ninety.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, but I thought he left you a thousand
pounds.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, I suppose that was a lucid interval....
Look here, <em>you</em> think it over seriously. I read a
book once about a fellow who stole another man’s novel.
Perhaps Blayds read it too and got it mixed up. Why
not at that age? Or perhaps he was thinking of using
the idea himself. And turning it over and over in his
mind, living with it, so to speak, day and night, he might
very easily begin to think that it was something that had
happened to himself. At his age. And then on his
death-bed, feeling that he must confess something—thoroughly
muddled, poor old fellow—well, you see
how easily it might happen. Hallucination.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>regarding him admiringly</i>).  You know, Oliver,
I think you underrate your intrinsic qualities as a
politician. You mustn’t waste yourself on engineering.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Thanks very much. I suppose Father hasn’t
mentioned the word “hallucination” to you yet?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, not yet.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Perhaps he hadn’t got my letter this morning.
But it’s worth thinking about, it is really.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>hard at it again</i>).  Yes, I am sure it is.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  You <span class="nw">know——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You know, Oliver, I’m really very busy.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  Oh, all right. And I want a
wash anyway. Is Father in his study?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes. Also very busy. If you really are

a moment.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Right. (<i>Turning to the door and seeing</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I thought I heard your voice. Did you
have an interesting time?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Rather! I was telling Royce. (<i>He takes

Quite all right. (<i>He kisses her hand</i>) Believe me, it’s
going to be absolutely all right. You see. (<i>He pats her

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>rather touched</i>).  Dear boy!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, Oliver has a great future in politics.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>going to the sofa</i>).  I’m tired.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You’ve been doing too much. Sit down and
rest a little.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>sitting</i>).  No, go on. I shan’t disturb you?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Talk to me. I’ve worked quite enough too.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Shall we be ready by to-morrow?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I think so.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I want to be rid of it—to get it out of my
head where it just goes round and round. It will be
a relief when the whole world knows. (<i>With a little
smile</i>) What a sensation for them!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes. (<i>Also smiling</i>) Isn’t it funny how that
comes in?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  The excitement at the back of one’s mind
when anything unusual happens, however disastrous.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Did I sound very excited?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You sounded alive for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  These last two days have helped me. It
has been a great comfort to have you here. It was
good of you to come.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  But of course I came.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>surprised</i>).  Yes.</p>

wife died ten years ago which I ought to have recognised?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>laughing</i>).  Well, no. But one always feels
that a fact with which one has lived for years must have
impressed itself somehow on others.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I didn’t know....</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>suddenly</i>).  I wish I could persuade you that
you were quite wrong not to take any of this money.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Am I “quite wrong”?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>shaking his head</i>).  No. That’s why it’s so
hopeless my trying to persuade you.... What are
you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>smiling</i>).  Well, there you are.... Oh, I
daresay it’s just pride, but somehow I can’t take the
money. The others can; you were right about that—I
was wrong; but they have not been so near to him
as I have.... I thought the whole world was at an
end at first. But <span class="nw">now——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  But now you don’t.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  No. I don’t know why. How hopeful we

be very proud of Man.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Let Him go on being proud of you.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh, I’m tough. You can’t be a nurse without
being tough. I shan’t break.</p>

of the early ones. I thought you had found them
all. You haven’t seen them, Mr. Royce?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  No, I’ve had nothing to do with them.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You found most of the early ones in the
bottom drawer of his desk, you told me.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>getting up</i>).  I may have overlooked one; I’ll
go and see. There was a great deal of rubbish there.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Can’t I?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Would you? You know where. Thank you
so much.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>going</i>).  Right.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Thank you very much, Mr. Royce, I’m
sorry to trouble you.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>There is a little silence after</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span> <i>is gone</i>. <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>

ones now</i>; <span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>is nervous and excited.
After much polishing of his glasses he begins.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Isobel, I have been thinking very deeply
of late about this terrible business.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>going to the desk</i>).  Is this the statement?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Is it?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>glancing over it</i>).  Yes ... yes. I’ve been
wondering if we’ve been going too far.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  About the money?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  No, no. No, no, I wasn’t thinking about
the money.</p>

<p><a name="png.263" id="png.263" href="#png.263"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>249<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What, then?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well.... Well.... I’m wondering....
Can we feel quite certain that if we make this announcement—can
we feel quite certain that we are not—well—going
too far?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You mean about the money?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  No, no, no, no.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Then what else? I don’t understand.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Suppose—I only say suppose—it were not
true. I mean, can we be so certain that it <em>is</em> true?
You see, once we make this announcement it is then
too late. We cannot contradict it afterwards and say
that we have made a mistake. It is irrevocable.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>hardly able to believe it</i>).  Are you suggesting
that we should—hush it up?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Now you are putting words into my mouth
that I have not yet used. I say that it has occurred
to me, thinking things over very earnestly, that possibly
we are in too much of a hurry to believe this
story of—er—this Jenkins story.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You mean that I have invented it, dreamed
it, imagined <span class="nw">it——?</span></p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  No, no, no, no, please. It would never
occur to me to suggest any such thing. What I do
suggest as a possibility worth considering is that Oliver
Blayds—er—imagined it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You mean he thought it was the other man’s
poetry when it was really his own?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You must remember that he was a very
old man. I was saying to Marion in this very room,
talking over what I understood then to be his last wish
for a simple funeral, that the dying words of an old man
were not to be taken too seriously. Indeed, I used
on that occasion this actual phrase, “An old man, his
faculties rapidly going.” I repeat the phrase. I say
<a name="png.264" id="png.264" href="#png.264"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>250<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>again that an old man, his faculties rapidly going, may
have imagined this story. In short, it has occurred
to me that the whole thing may very well be—hallucination.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>looking at him fixedly</i>).  Or self-deception.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>misunderstanding her</i>).  Exactly. Well, in
short, I suggest there never was anybody called Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>brightly—after a pause</i>).  Wouldn’t it be nice?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  One can understand how upon his death-bed
a man feels the need of confession, of forgiveness
and absolution. It may well be that Oliver Blayds, instinctively
feeling this need, bared his soul to you, not
of some real misdeed of his own, but of some imaginary
misdeed with which, by who knows what association
of ideas, his mind had become occupied.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You mean he meant to confess to a murder
or something, and got muddled.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Heaven forbid that I should attribute any
misdeed to so noble, so knightly a man as Oliver
Blayds.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Knightly?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I am of course assuming that this man
Jenkins never existed.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh, you <em>are</em> assuming that?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The more I think of it, the more plain it
becomes to me that we <em>must</em> assume it.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, I quite see that the more one thinks of
it, the <span class="nw">more——</span> (<i>She indicates the rest of the sentence
with her fingers.</i>)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well, what do you think of the suggestion?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It’s so obvious that I’m wondering why it
didn’t occur to you before.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The truth is I was stunned.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh yes.</p>

<p><a name="png.265" id="png.265" href="#png.265"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>251<span class="ns">]</span></span></a><span
 class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  And then, I confess, the fact of the 1863
volume seemed for the moment conclusive.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  But now it doesn’t?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I explain it now, as one always explained
it when he was alive. Every great poet has these
lapses.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh! (<i>She is silent, looking at</i> <span class="role">WILLIAM</span> <i>wonderingly,
almost admiringly</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>after waiting for her comment</i>).  Well?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What can I say, William, except again how
nice it will be? No scandal, no poverty, no fuss, and
his life in two volumes just as before. We are a little
too late for the Abbey, but, apart from that, everything
is as nice as it can be.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>solemnly</i>).  You have not mentioned the
best thing of all, Isobel.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>looking up reverently at the picture</i>).  That our
faith in him has not been misplaced.</p>

<p class="hang">(<i>She wonders at him, not knowing whether to laugh

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>turning to her blankly</i>).  News?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  About the hallucination. I always felt that
there must have been some mistake. And now our
faith has been justified—as faith always is. It’s such
a comfort to know. Really to know at last. Poor
dear Grandfather! He was so very old. I think
sometimes we forget how very old he was. And the
excitement of that last day—his birthday—and perhaps
the glass of port. No wonder.</p>

from every point of view.</p>

money, then?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>who obviously isn’t</i>).  Er—yes—I.... That
is to say, that, while absolutely satisfied that this man
Jenkins never existed, I—at the same time—I—well,
perhaps to be on the safe side—there are certain
charities.... As I say, there <em>are</em> certain charities
for distressed writers, and so on, and perhaps one would

I’m glad we aren’t going to be bothered about money.
It would have been an impossible business to settle.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Now I understand everything.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  The 1863 volume. That always puzzled
me. Always! Now, at last, we have the true explanation.
(<i>Dramatically</i>) The 1863 volume was written by
Jenkins!</p>

<p class="hang">(<span class="role">ISOBEL</span> <i>and</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span> <i>look at him in amazement</i>;
<span class="role">MARION</span> <i>in admiration</i>.)</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>to himself</i>).  Poor old Jenkins.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  Of course I liked all Grandfather’s poetry.
There was some of it I didn’t understand, but I felt
that <em>he</em> <span class="nw">knew——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  No, we can be frank now. The 1863
volume was bad. And now we see why. He wished
to give this dear dead friend of his a chance. I can
see these two friends—Oliver—and—<span class="nw">er——</span> (<i>Going to</i>
<span class="role">ROYCE</span>) What was Mr.—er—Jenkins’ other name?
(<i>He reads it over</i> <span class="role">ROYCE’S</span> <i>shoulder</i>) Ah, yes, Willoughby—I
can see that last scene when Willoughby lay dying,
and his friend Oliver stood by his side. I can hear
Willoughby lamenting that none of his poetry will ever
be heard now in the mouths of others—and Oliver’s
silent resolve that in some way, at some time, Willoughby’s
work shall be given to the world. And so in 1863,
when his own position was firmly established, he issues
<a name="png.269" id="png.269" href="#png.269"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>255<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>this little collection of his dead friend’s poetry, these
few choicest sheaves from poor Willoughby’s indiscriminate
harvest, sheltering them, as he hoped, from
the storm of criticism with the mantle of his own great
name. A noble resolve, a chivalrous undertaking, but
alas! of no avail.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You will say this in your life of Oliver
Blayds?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I shall—er—hint at the doubtful authorship
of the 1863 volume; perhaps it would be better
not to go into the matter too fully.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">ISOBEL</span>). It would be much nicer, dear,
if we didn’t refer to any of the unhappy thoughts
which we have all had about Grandfather in the last
few days. We know now that we never ought to have
doubted. He was—Grandfather.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>after a pause, to</i> <span class="role">ROYCE</span>). Well? (<i>He shrugs his
shoulders.</i>) Will you find the children? I think they
ought to know this.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Right. Do you want me to come back?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Please. (<i>He goes out. When he has gone she

about Oliver Blayds.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  But that’s what we all want to do, dear.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  What do you mean by the truth?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What we all know to be the truth in our
hearts.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I deny it. I deny it utterly. I am convinced
that the explanation which I have given is the
true one.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Then I shall publish the explanation which
he gave <em>me</em>.</p>

Blayds.</p>

try very hard. I have found it a great comfort.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  I must beg you to reconsider your decision.
I had the honour of the friendship of Oliver Blayds for
many years, and I tell you frankly that I will not allow
this slander of a dead man to pass unchallenged.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Which dead man?</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>a little upset</i>).  This slander on Oliver Blayds.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  We have been talking over what I told you

it was the 1863 volume which was written by this man,

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  You had discussed it before?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>to</i> <span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>). And you?</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span> (<i>shocked</i>).  Septima! Your father!</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Well, you asked me what I said, and I’m

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>coldly</i>).  Kindly explain yourself a little
more lucidly.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s all rot saying <span class="nw">“rot”——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  One at a time, please. Septima?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I think it’s rot, trying to deceive ourselves
by making up a story about Grandfather, just because
we don’t like the one which he told Aunt Isobel. What
does it all matter anyhow? There’s the poetry, and
jolly good too, most of it. What does it matter when
you’ve quoted it, whether you add, “As Blayds nobly
said” or “As Jenkins nobly said”? It’s the same
poetry. There was Grandfather. We all knew him
well, and we all had plenty of chances of making up
our minds about him. How can what he did seventy
years ago, when he was another person altogether, make
any difference to our opinion of him? And then there’s
the money. I said that it ought to be ours, and it is
ours. Well, there we are.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  You are quite content that your Aunt
should publish, as she proposes to, this story of—er—Willoughby
Jenkins, which I am convinced is a base
libel on the reputation of Oliver Blayds?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I say, Aunt Isobel, are you really going to?
I mean do you <em>still</em> <span class="nw">believe——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I am afraid I do, Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Good Lord!</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  Well—Septima?</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  I am quite content with the truth. And
if you want the truth about Septima Blayds-Conway,
<a name="png.272" id="png.272" href="#png.272"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>258<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>it is that the truth about Blayds is not really any great
concern of hers.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, that’s a pretty selfish way of looking
at it.</p>

<p><span class="role">MARION</span>.  I don’t know what Grandfather would say
if he could hear you.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Thank you, Septima. You’re honest anyhow.</p>

<p><span class="role">SEPTIMA</span>.  Well, of course.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  It’s all very well for <em>her</em> to talk like that,
but it’s a jolly big concern of mine. If it comes out,
I’m done. As a politician anyway.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  What do <em>you</em> believe, Oliver?</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  I told you. Hallucination. At least it
seems just as likely as the other. And that being so,
I think we ought to give it the benefit of the doubt.
What <em>is</em> the truth about Blayds—I don’t <span class="nw">know——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>calmly</i>).  I do, Oliver.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span> (<i>sharply</i>).  So do I.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Well, I mean, there you are. Probably the
truth lies somewhere in <span class="nw">between——</span></p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>with a smile, speaking almost unconsciously</i>). 
No, no, you mustn’t waste yourself on engineering.
(<i>Recovering himself with a start</i>) I beg your pardon.</p>

<p><span class="role">OLIVER</span>.  Anyway, I’m with Father. I don’t think
we ought to take the risk of doing Oliver Blayds an
injustice by saying anything about this—this hallucination.</p>

<p><span class="role">WILLIAM</span>.  There is no question of risk. It’s a certainty.
Come, Marion. (<i>He leads the way to the door.</i>)
We have much to do. (<i>Challengingly</i>) We have much

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  How absurd!</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  I was afraid you wouldn’t appreciate it.
Well, what are you going to do?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  What can I do but tell the world the truth?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  H’m! I wonder if the world will be grateful.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Does that matter?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Yes, I think it does. I think you ought to
feel that you are benefiting somebody—other than
yourself.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>with a smile</i>).  I am hardly benefiting myself.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Not materially, of course—but spiritually?
Aren’t you just easing your conscience?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I don’t see why the poor thing shouldn’t be
eased.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  At the other people’s expense?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Oh, but no, Austin, no. I’m sure that’s
wrong. Surely the truth means more than that.
Surely it’s an end in itself. The only end. Call it
Truth or call it Beauty, it’s all we’re here for.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  You know, the trouble is that the Truth
about Blayds won’t seem very beautiful. There’s your
<a name="png.274" id="png.274" href="#png.274"><span class="pagenum"><span
 class="ns">[</span>260<span class="ns">]</span></span></a>truth, and then there’s William’s truth, too. To the
public it will seem not so much like Beauty as like an
undignified family squabble. And William will win.
His story can be made to sound so much more likely
than yours. No, it’s no good. You can’t start another
miserable Shakespeare-Bacon controversy. Because
that is what it would be in a few years. There would
be no established truth, but just a Jenkins’ theory.
Hadn’t we better just leave him with the poetry?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  It seems so unfair that this poor dead boy
should be robbed of the immortality which he wanted.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  Hasn’t he got it? There are his works.
Didn’t he have the wonderful happiness and pain of
writing them? How can you do anything for him
now? It’s just pure sentiment, isn’t it?</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span> (<i>meekly</i>).  If you say so, sir.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span> (<i>laughing</i>).  Am I lecturing? I’m sorry.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  No, I don’t mind. And I expect you’re
right. I can’t do anything. (<i>After a pause</i>) Are one’s
motives ever pure?</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  One hopes so. One never knows.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  I keep telling myself that I want the truth
to prevail—but is it only that? Or is it that I want to
punish him?... He hurt me so. All those years
he was pretending that I helped him. And all the time
it was just a game to him. A game—and he was
laughing. Do you wonder that I was bitter? It was
just a game to him.</p>

<p><span class="role">ROYCE</span>.  As he said, he carried it off.</p>

<p><span class="role">ISOBEL</span>.  Yes, he carried it off.... Even in those
last moments he was carrying it off. Just that. He
was frightened at first—he was dying; it was so lonely
in the grave; there was no audience there; no one to
listen, to admire. Only God. Ah, but when he had
begun his story, how quickly he was the artist again!

it all right for you.” Oh, he had his qualities, Oliver
Blayds. My father, yes; but somehow he never
